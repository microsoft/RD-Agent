# 🏆 The Best Machine Learning Engineering Agent!

[MLE-bench](https://github.com/openai/mle-bench) is a comprehensive benchmark evaluating the performance of AI agents on machine learning engineering tasks. Utilizing datasets from 75 Kaggle competitions, MLE-bench provides robust assessments of AI systems' capabilities in real-world ML engineering scenarios.

R&D-Agent currently leads as the top-performing machine learning engineering agent on MLE-bench:

| Agent | Low == Lite (%) | Medium (%) | High (%) | All (%) |
|---------|--------|-----------|---------|----------|
| R&D-Agent o1-preview | 48.18 ± 2.49 | 8.95 ± 2.36 | 18.67 ± 2.98 | 22.4 ± 1.1 |
| R&D-Agent o3(R)+GPT-4.1(D) | 51.52 ± 6.21 | 7.89 ± 3.33 | 16.67 ± 3.65 | 22.45 ± 2.45 |
| AIDE o1-preview | 34.3 ± 2.4 | 8.8 ± 1.1 | 10.0 ± 1.9 | 16.9 ± 1.1 |

**Notes:**
- **O3(R)+GPT-4.1(D)**: This version is designed to both reduce average time per loop and leverage a cost-effective combination of backend LLMs by seamlessly integrating Research Agent (o3) with Development Agent (GPT-4.1).
- **AIDE o1-preview**: Represents the previously best public result on MLE-bench as reported in the original MLE-bench paper.
- Average and standard deviation results for R&D-Agent o1-preview is based on a independent of 5 seeds and for R&D-Agent o3(R)+GPT-4.1(D) is based on 6 seeds.
- According to MLE-Bench, the 75 competitions are categorized into three levels of complexity: **Low==Lite** if we estimate that an experienced ML engineer can produce a sensible solution in under 2 hours, excluding the time taken to train any models; **Medium** if it takes between 2 and 10 hours; and **High** if it takes more than 10 hours.

You can inspect the detailed runs of the above results online.

# 🥇 The First Data-Centric Quant Multi-Agent Framework!

R&D-Agent for Quantitative Finance, in short **RD-Agent(Q)**, is the first data-centric, multi-agent framework designed to automate the full-stack research and development of quantitative strategies via coordinated factor-model co-optimization.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3198bc10-47ba-4ee0-8a8e-46d5ce44f45d)

Extensive experiments in real stock markets show that, at a cost under $10, RD-Agent(Q) achieves approximately 2× higher ARR than benchmark factor libraries while using over 70% fewer factors. It also surpasses state-of-the-art deep time-series models under smaller resource budgets. Its alternating factor–model optimization further delivers excellent trade-off between predictive accuracy and strategy robustness.

You can learn more details about **RD-Agent(Q)** through the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15155) and reproduce it through the [documentation](https://rdagent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scens/quant_agent_fin.html).

# 🌟 Introduction
<div align="center">
      <img src="docs/_static/scen.png" alt="Our focused scenario" style="width:80%; ">
</div>

R&D-Agent aims to automate the most critical and valuable aspects of the industrial R&D process, and we begin with focusing on the data-driven scenarios to streamline the development of models and data. 
Methodologically, we have identified a framework with two key components: 'R' for proposing new ideas and 'D' for implementing them.
We believe that the automatic evolution of R&D will lead to solutions of significant industrial value.

You can click the links above to view the demo. We're continuously adding more methods and scenarios to the project to enhance your R&D processes and boost productivity. 

Additionally, you can take a closer look at the examples in our **[🖥️ Live Demo](https://rdagent.azurewebsites.net/)**.

<div align="center">
    <a href="https://rdagent.azurewebsites.net/" target="_blank">
        <img src="docs/_static/demo.png" alt="Watch the demo" width="80%">
    </a>
</div>


# ⚡ Quick start

You can try above demos by running the following command:

### 🐳 Docker installation.
Users must ensure Docker is installed before attempting most scenarios. Please refer to the [official 🐳Docker page](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) for installation instructions.
Ensure the current user can run Docker commands **without using sudo**. You can verify this by executing `docker run hello-world`.

### 🐍 Create a Conda Environment
- Create a new conda environment with Python (3.10 and 3.11 are well-tested in our CI):
  ```sh
  conda create -n rdagent python=3.10
  ```
- Activate the environment:
  ```sh
  conda activate rdagent
  ```

### 🛠️ Install the R&D-Agent
- You can directly install the R&D-Agent package from PyPI:
  ```sh
  pip install rdagent
  ```

### 💊 Health check
- rdagent provides a health check that currently checks two things.
  - whether the docker installation was successful.
  - whether the default port used by the [rdagent ui](https://github.com/microsoft/RD-Agent?tab=readme-ov-file#%EF%B8%8F-monitor-the-application-results) is occupied.
  ```sh
  rdagent health_check
  ```


### ⚙️ Configuration
- The demos requires following ability:
  - ChatCompletion
  - json_mode
  - embedding query

- For example: If you are using the `OpenAI API`, you have to configure your GPT model in the `.env` file like this.
  ```bash
  cat << EOF  > .env
  OPENAI_API_KEY=<replace_with_your_openai_api_key>
  # EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
  CHAT_MODEL=gpt-4-turbo
  EOF
  ```
- However, not every API services support these features by default. For example: `AZURE OpenAI`, you have to configure your GPT model in the `.env` file like this.
  ```bash
  cat << EOF  > .env
  USE_AZURE=True
  EMBEDDING_OPENAI_API_KEY=<replace_with_your_azure_openai_api_key>
  EMBEDDING_AZURE_API_BASE=<replace_with_your_azure_endpoint>
  EMBEDDING_AZURE_API_VERSION=<replace_with_the_version_of_your_azure_openai_api>
  EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
  CHAT_OPENAI_API_KEY=<replace_with_your_azure_openai_api_key>
  CHAT_AZURE_API_BASE=<replace_with_your_azure_endpoint>
  CHAT_AZURE_API_VERSION=<replace_with_the_version_of_your_azure_openai_api>
  CHAT_MODEL=<replace_it_with_the_name_of_your_azure_chat_model>
  EOF
  ```

- We now support LiteLLM as a backend for integration with multiple LLM providers. If you use LiteLLM Backend to use models, you can configure as follows:
  ```bash
  cat << EOF  > .env
  BACKEND=rdagent.oai.backend.LiteLLMAPIBackend
  # It can be modified to any model supported by LiteLLM.
  CHAT_MODEL=gpt-4o
  EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small
  # The backend api_key fully follow the convention of litellm.
  OPENAI_API_KEY=<replace_with_your_openai_api_key>
  ```
  
- For more configuration information, please refer to the [documentation](https://rdagent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation_and_configuration.html).

  rdagent kaggle --competition <your competition name>

  # Specifically, you need to create a folder for storing competition files (e.g., competition description file, competition datasets, etc.), and configure the path to the folder in your environment. In addition, you need to use chromedriver when you download the competition descriptors, which you can follow for this specific example:
  
  # 1. Install chromedriver.

  # 2. Add the competition description file path to the `.env` file.
  mkdir -p ./git_ignore_folder/kaggle_data
  dotenv set KG_LOCAL_DATA_PATH "$(pwd)/git_ignore_folder/kaggle_data"

  # 3. run the application
  rdagent kaggle --competition sf-crime
  ```
  > **Description of the above example:** <br />
  > - Kaggle competition data is roughly divided into three sections: competition description file (json file) and complete dataset for the competition and simplified dataset for the competition. <br />
  > - The Kaggle competition data will be downloaded automatically, the download process depends on `chromedriver`, installation instructions can be found in the [documentation](https://rdagent.readthedocs.io/en/latest/scens/kaggle_agent.html#example-guide). <br />

  You can check if a port is occupied by running the following command.

  ```sh
  rdagent health_check
  ```

# 🏭 Scenarios

We have applied R&D-Agent to multiple valuable data-driven industrial scenarios.


## 🎯 Goal: Agent for Data-driven R&D

In this project, we are aiming to build an Agent to automate Data-Driven R\&D that can
+ 📄 Read real-world material (reports, papers, etc.) and **extract** key formulas, descriptions of interested **features** and **models**, which are the key components of data-driven R&D .
+ 🛠️ **Implement** the extracted formulas (e.g., features, factors, and models) in runnable codes.
   + Due to the limited ability of LLM in implementing at once, build an evolving process for the agent to improve performance by learning from feedback and knowledge.
+ 💡 Propose **new ideas** based on current knowledge and observations.

<!-- ![Data-Centric R&D Overview](docs/_static/overview.png) -->

## 📈 Scenarios/Demos

In the two key areas of data-driven scenarios, model implementation and data building, our system aims to serve two main roles: 🦾Copilot and 🤖Agent. 
- The 🦾Copilot follows human instructions to automate repetitive tasks. 
- The 🤖Agent, being more autonomous, actively proposes ideas for better results in the future.

The supported scenarios are listed below:

| Scenario/Target | Model Implementation                   | Data Building                                                                      |

# ⚙️ Framework

<div align="center">
    <img src="docs/_static/Framework-RDAgent.png" alt="Framework-RDAgent" width="85%">
</div>


Automating the R&D process in data science is a highly valuable yet underexplored area in industry. We propose a framework to push the boundaries of this important research field.

The research questions within this framework can be divided into three main categories:
| Research Area | Paper/Work List |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| **Benchmark the R&D abilities** | [Benchmark](#benchmark) |
| **Idea proposal:** Explore new ideas or refine existing ones | [Research](#research) |
| **Ability to realize ideas:** Implement and execute ideas | [Development](#development) |

We believe that the key to delivering high-quality solutions lies in the ability to evolve R&D capabilities. Agents should learn like human experts, continuously improving their R&D skills.

## 🔍 Research

In a data mining expert's daily research and development process, they propose a hypothesis (e.g., a model structure like RNN can capture patterns in time-series data), design experiments (e.g., finance data contains time-series and we can verify the hypothesis in this scenario), implement the experiment as code (e.g., Pytorch model structure), and then execute the code to get feedback (e.g., metrics, loss curve, etc.). The experts learn from the feedback and improve in the next iteration.

Based on the principles above, we have established a basic method framework that continuously proposes hypotheses, verifies them, and gets feedback from the real-world practice. This is the first scientific research automation framework that supports linking with real-world verification.

Before we released R&D-Agent as an open-source project on GitHub, it was an internal project within our group. Unfortunately, the internal commit history was not preserved when we removed some confidential code. As a result, some contributions from our group members, including Haotian Chen, Wenjun Feng, Haoxue Wang, Zeqi Ye, Xinjie Shen, and Jinhui Li, were not included in the public commits.
