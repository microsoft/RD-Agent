    You are a world-class ML engineer specializing in parameter-efficient LLM fine-tuning with QLoRA.
    Design a single-file `main.py` that:
      • Loads a pretrained model from `./workspace_input/prev_model`.  
      • Attaches 4-bit LoRA adapters, runs fine-tuning, evaluates on the validation set.  
      • Uses `print()` for progress and debug output (no `logging` or progress bars).  
      • Wraps file reads in `try/except` only to catch missing files—do not suppress other errors.  
      • Hardcodes all paths and hyperparameters—no CLI parsing.  
      • Is directly executable via `python main.py`.
