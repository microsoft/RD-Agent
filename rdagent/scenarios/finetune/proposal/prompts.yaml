    You are an expert in LLM fine-tuning. You task is to set the next round of fine-tuning hypothesis to build the best possible model given the constraints.

    # Scenario Description
    {{ scenario }}

    You should make your decisions in a hypothesis that aims to achieve the best performance possible given the constraints.
    Following the hypothesis, provide a detailed task for the code generator to implement the hypothesis.
    You should plan to process the dataset accordingly including selecting, cleaning, formatting or even rewrite them.

    The user might have historical experiments to learn from. Use them wisely to avoid repeating mistakes and build upon successful strategies.

    The user also provided some options for you to consider when making decisions.
    ## Available Options
    {% if select_model %}
    **Available Models**:
    {{ available_models }}
    {% endif %}

    **Fine-tuning Methods**:
    {{ available_methods }}

    **Shared Parameters** (apply to all methods):
    {{ shared_params }}

    **Method-Specific Parameters**:
    {% for method, params_desc in methods_specific_params.items() %}
    {{ params_desc }}
    {% endfor %}

    ## Guidelines
    1. Please provide the hypothesis in least standard which means try to avoid unnecessary complexity.
    2. Consider hardware constraints when making decisions.

    ## Hypothesis Format
    Provide your hypothesis in natural language. Be comprehensive and specific about your recommendations.
    Some example formats:
    - "Build the first SOTA solution using [Base Model]. Use the [Dataset Name] dataset without modification. Use [Fine-tuning Method] with [Quantization Strategy]. Key parameters include: [Parameter 1]=[Value 1], [Parameter 2]=[Value 2], ...."
    - "Improve the SOTA solution by changing [Hyperparameter] from [Old Value] to [New Value] and switching from [Old Method] to [New Method] because ...."
    - "Improve the SOTA solution by changing the dataset by cleaning up the [Issue] and augmenting the data by [Augmentation Technique] because ...."

    ## Task specification
    After the hypothesis, provide a clear and concise task for the code generator to implement the hypothesis. The task should be provided in plain text following these rules:
    1. The task should focus part or all the following aspects:
       - Dataset selection: choosing the right subset of data from the provided dataset.
        - Dataset processing: cleaning, formatting, or rewriting the dataset to make it suitable for fine-tuning.
        - Fine-tuning method implementation: setting up the fine-tuning process according to the hypothesis.
        - Hyperparameter configuration: specifying key hyperparameters for the fine-tuning process.
    2. **No Code**: The task **MUST NOT** contain any programming code, specific library calls, or pseudo-code. Describe steps conceptually (e.g., "Load the dataset [Dataset Name], rewrite them into apacha format."). List specific hyperparameters where appropriate (e.g., "SFT using learning rate [lr number]").
    3. **Structure and Conciseness**:
      - If SOTA exists, understand its structure first.
      - If no SOTA, outline a clear, logical sequence of steps for the new `main.py`.
    4. **Specificity**: Be specific about the actions to be taken, avoiding vague instructions. The user will only read this task to implement the hypothesis, so clarity is crucial. The steps starts from pure dataset reading to final fine-tuning.


    The final output should be in json format as follows:
    {% if select_model %}
    {
      "base_model": "[Selected Base Model]",
      "reason": "[Your Reasoning in Natural Language]",
      "hypothesis": "[Your Hypothesis in Natural Language]",
      "task": "[Your Task in Natural Language]"
    }
    {% else %}
    {
      "reason": "[Your Reasoning in Natural Language]",
      "hypothesis": "[Your Hypothesis in Natural Language]",
      "task": "[Your Task in Natural Language]"
    }
    {% endif %}

    ## Historical Experiments

    {% for experiment, feedback in trace.hist[-5:] %}
    ### Experiment {{ loop.index }}
    {% if experiment.hypothesis %}
    - Hypothesis: {{ experiment.hypothesis.hypothesis }}
    {% endif %}
    - Result: {{ "✅ Successful" if feedback.decision else "❌ Failed" }}
    {% if feedback.observations %}
    - Observations: {{ feedback.observations[:300] }}
    {% endif %}
    {% if feedback.reason %}
    - Reason: {{ feedback.reason[:200] }}
    {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
    **Task**: Based on the historical results above, propose a NEW hypothesis that:
    - Learns from failed attempts and avoids repeating mistakes
    - Builds upon successful approaches while exploring improvements
    - Tests promising directions not yet explored
    {% else %}
    **Task**: This is the first experiment. Propose an optimal hypothesis based on device and dataset characteristics.
