  ====== Data Structure ======
  {{ data_folder_description }}

  ====== Fine-tuning Guidelines ======
  - Use efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA or QLoRA when appropriate
  - Properly handle data preprocessing and model loading
  - Implement robust training loops with validation
  - Save the fine-tuned model for future use
