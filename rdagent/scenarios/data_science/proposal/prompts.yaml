    # Hypothesis Proposal

    The user has already proposed several hypotheses and conducted evaluations on them. This information will be provided to you later. Your task is to check if a similar hypothesis has already been generated. If one exists and you agree with it, you can use it. If you disagree, please create an improved version.

    To assist you in formulating new hypotheses, the user has provided some additional information: 
    Hypothesis should avoid being too general and vague, and should be specific and actionable. For example, hypothesis like 'tune a model' is too general, while hypothesis like 'increase the learning rate to 0.1 of the lightgbm model will improve the performance' is specific and actionable.
    Your hypothesis should based on current SOTA solution. The user will conduct experiments based on the SOTA solution(current best experiments) to test whether your hypothesis is right on this specific competition.
