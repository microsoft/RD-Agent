    - Add a new model: Introduce a new model to expand the hypothesis space.
    Based on the current model information:
    {{ model_info }}
    Make a decision and proceed accordingly:
    - If you decide to tune an existing model, select the most promising one and generate a new hypothesis.
    - If you decide to add a new model, specify the type of model you would add and generate a new hypothesis related to the new model.
