    The user is improving a Kaggle competition implementation iteratively through traces where each new trace is modified from the current SOTA in the trace. If new trace surpasses the current SOTA, it will be the new SOTA. If not, it will be a failed experiment.
    You will be provide with: 
      1. A detailed competition scenario description;
      2. Previous SOTA experiments and feedbacks, which are past SOTA experiments indexed from oldest to newest;
      3. Previous failed experiments and feedbacks, which are ordered attempts that did not surpass the current SOTA implementation;
    Your task is to analyze the given information and extract the **Scenario Problems** from the given materials.

    ## Scenario Problems
    ### Definition
    Scenario problems are specific, context-dependent challenges arising from a competition's dataset or domain. They fall into two categories:
    1. Dataset Characteristics: Inherent structural or statistical properties of the dataset (such as imbalance, high dimensionality, collinearity, outliers, missing data, skewed distribution, time-based patterns, etc.).
    2. Domain-specific Insights: Actionable knowledge derived from expertise in the competition's domain, enabling correct interpretation of data patterns or constraints. These insights are not evident from the data alone and require external context to resolve ambiguities, engineer features, or avoid invalid assumptions.

    ### Specification
    {{ problem_spec }}
    
    ### Core Analysis Dimensions
    1. SOTA Mismatch Diagnosis: Systematically compare current implementations against both data properties and domain knowledge to identify critical discrepancies.
    2. Gap Forensic Analysis: Examine successful solutions to reveal unstated problems they implicitly address through workarounds.
    3. Domain-Implementation Conflict Detection: Identify instances where technical approaches violate domain constraints or oversimplify complex relationships.
    4. In case there is no SOTA implementation, your scenario problem should focus on the scenario itself.

    Your task is to analyze the given information and extract the **Feedback Problems** from the previous experiments or the current SOTA implementation.

    ## Feedback Problems
    ### Definition
    Feedback problems are specific and fine-grained technical, or methodological issues within the previous experiments or the current SOTA implementation.

    ### Guidelines
    Here are few guidelines to help you identify the feedback problems:
    1. Feedback Analysis
      - Extract explicit issues directly stated in the feedback.
      - Infer implicit issues from feedback context.
    2. Code Review
      - Feature Engineering. Check for missing, redundant, or improper features and the mismatch between features and models.
      - Model Architecture. Assess the compatibility between the model type and the problem domain. Verify model architecture and hyperparameters.
      - Ensemble. Check if ensemble methods are optimized. Identify underperforming base models to remove from the ensemble.
      - Training. Validate hyperparameter (e.g., learning rate, batch size), loss functions, and regularization. Determine if hyperparameters are optimized based on prior experiment traces.
    3. Trace History Analysis
      - Flag unresolved and persistent issues recurring across traces.
      - Highlight partial fixes (e.g., inappropriate feature engineering).
      - Identify unexplored directions (e.g. new features, new model structures) from prior traces.
      - Identify potential unsolved time/memory constraints from previous experiments trace.

    {% if enable_idea_pool %}
    In order to assist you in the hypothesis proposal, the user has sampled a list of ideas for each of the identified problems.
    The ideas are extracted methods or techniques from previous SOTA implementations of other competitions.
    These ideas can potentially tackle the identified problems and improve the current SOTA implementation but you should decide whether to use them or not.
    To specific problem, if you choose to use the given idea, you should modify it to a proper hypothesis and also mark the inspired flag as True.
    {% endif %}

    # Task 1: Hypothesis Proposal
    For each identified problem, propose a hypothesis to improve the current SOTA implementation.

    ## Hypothesis Guidelines
    Here are few guidelines to help you formulate hypotheses:
    1. Problem Impact Analysis
      - Quantify how the problem degrades performance.
    2. Previous Experiments Analysis
      - For previous SOTA experiments, analyze insights and implicit patterns that can be leveraged to improve the current SOTA implementation.
      - For failed experiments, think about the persistent problems they facing. If these experiments consistently failed due to time/memory constraints, prioritize changes on efficiency.
    3. Actionable Changes
      - If the problem relates to time/memory constraints, consider smaller model sizes or alternative algorithms with reduced complexity.
      - If the problem involves underperforming models, propose removing or replacing models of significantly worse performance.
      - If the problem relates to hyperparameter tuning, recommend a specific method or strategy for tuning.
    4. Note on Time/Memory Constraints
      - If prior experiments failed due to time/memory limitations, assume your new hypothesis will face the same constraints. In this case, prioritize efficiency and **ONLY** response to the problems related to time/memory constraints in your response dictionary.
      - Besides, do not compromise performance merely for efficiency since the current SOTA implementation do not encounter the constraints. You should think about how to balance the efficiency and performance so that your new hypothesis can be executed successfully and achieve satisfactory performance. 
    5. Note on Drafting the First Implementation
      - In case there is no SOTA implementation, you should draft the first implementation. In this case, your hypothesis should not only cover the problem but also on the overall design such as how to do the feature engineering and the model selection.
    {% if enable_idea_pool %}
    6. Idea Reference
      - Each idea is a method, technique or trick that contributes to high performance from other competition implementation under similar problem. You are free to use them as an inspiration for your hypothesis proposal.
    {% endif %}

    ## Hypothesis Specification
    {{ hypothesis_spec }}


    # Task 2: Hypothesis Evaluation
    After proposing the hypothesis, your second task is to evaluate the hypothesis from multiple dimensions.

    ## Evaluation Instruction
    Firstly, you should tag the hypothesis with one of the following components. If the hypothesis is related to multiple components, you should choose the most relevant one.
    {{ component_desc }}

    Secondly, please score the proposed hypothesis from 1 to 10 for each of the following dimensions (where 1 means lowest and 10 means highest):
    1. Problem-Hypothesis Alignment: How well the hypothesis addresses the identified problem.
    2. Expected Impact: The estimated improvement after applying the hypothesis to current SOTA implementation.
    3. Novelty: Degree of innovation compared to previous attempts. If the proposed hypothesis is similar to previous experiments' hypothesis, assign novelty score to one.
    4. Feasibility: The ease of implementing the proposed hypothesis in the current SOTA implementation.
    5. Risk-Reward Balance: The exploration-exploitation balance of the proposed hypothesis.

    The user is improving a Kaggle competition implementation iteratively through traces where each new trace is modified from the current SOTA in the trace, not necessarily the immediate predecessor.
    You will be provided with: 
      1. A detailed competition scenario description;
      2. Previous SOTA experiments and feedbacks, which are past SOTA experiments indexed from oldest to newest;
      3. Previous failed experiments and feedbacks, which are ordered attempts that did not surpass the current SOTA implementation;

      5. A proposed hypothesis to improve the current SOTA implementation;

    # Step 1: Task Design
    Your first task is to generate new {{ targets }} based on the proposed hypothesis. Your task should very detailed with specific steps and instructions. The task should be specific and fine-grained, avoiding general or vague statements.

    ## Specification
    {{ task_specification }}

    ## Task Design Guidelines
    1. The task should be concise with several steps each only in a few sentences. 
    2. DO NOT repeat the details which has already included in the SOTA code. If the SOTA code has covered the steps perfectly, you should not repeat the steps in detail. 
    3. DO NOT write any code in the task description!
    4. Observe reasons from failed experiments and feedback to prevent repeating similar mistakes in analogous situations.
    5. Specific and Non-Vague
      - Avoid vague statements like "choose a proper model" Instead, specify the exact task to be made.
      - No phrases like "for example" or "eg.," should be used in the task. Give a clear decision in the task.
    6. Resource limitations
      - The user will give you some failed experiments and feedbacks. If the former experiments faced time/memory constraints, it means it's very likely that your generated task will also face the same constraints. In this case, you should design a task that prioritize efficiency in terms of time and space complexity.
      - If you plan to prioritize efficiency, you can modify the parts which is not related to the hypothesis. Which means your task should still able to validate the hypothesis.
      - Add [EFFICIENCY AS PRIORITY] tag in the task description to indicate that the task takes efficiency as a priority.
      - Although the task should prioritize efficiency, it should not be the only focus. The task should also be aligned with the proposed hypothesis and the current SOTA implementation.
