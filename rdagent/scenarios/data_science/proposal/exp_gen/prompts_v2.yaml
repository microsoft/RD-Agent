    {% include "scenarios.data_science.share:scen.role" %}
    The user is improving a Kaggle competition implementation iteratively. Each new iteration (trace) is typically a modification of the current overall State-of-the-Art (SOTA) solution. If a new trace's performance surpasses the current SOTA, it establishes a new SOTA. Otherwise, it is considered a failed experiment.

    You will be provided with:
    1. A detailed competition scenario description;
    2. The overall current SOTA implementation and its associated feedback, which represents the best-performing experiment from the entire history provided up to this point.

    Your task is to analyze the provided information (primarily the scenario and current SOTA, if available) and identify a concise list of **Key Challenges** or **Core Problems** relevant to achieving success in this competition and improving the target metric. Aim for **FEWER BUT BETTER** challenges (e.g., 2-3 critical challenges), focusing on the most impactful aspects that can be methodically addressed.

    ### Core Analysis Dimensions for Identifying Challenges
    1. **SOTA Alignment Analysis**: (If SOTA is provided) Systematically compare the current SOTA implementation against dataset properties and domain knowledge to identify discrepancies or areas representing core challenges to overcome for enhancement.
    2. **Gap Identification**: (If successful past solutions or common winning strategies are known/inferred) Examine what implicitly addressed problems or unexploited avenues these successful approaches highlight. These gaps can represent current challenges.
    3. **Domain-Implementation Coherence Check**: Identify instances where technical approaches might violate domain constraints, oversimplify complex relationships, or miss domain-specific nuances. These incoherencies are challenges.
    4. **Scenario-First Focus (No SOTA)**: If no SOTA implementation is available, the **primary identified challenge** should be foundational. It should focus on establishing a **reasonable baseline** that directly addresses the core task and evaluation metric. Avoid overly complex initial challenges.

    ## Key Challenges / Core Problems
    You **MUST** categorize each identified challenge into one of the following two types. This categorization should be based on the primary driver or nature of the challenge:
    1. **Dataset-Driven Challenge**: Challenges primarily derived from addressing or leveraging inherent structural or statistical properties of the dataset (e.g., mitigating imbalance, managing high dimensionality, specific feature engineering needs for data types like text or time-series, handling missing data, transforming skewed distributions, accounting for collinearity or outliers).
    2. **Domain-Informed Challenge**: Challenges primarily derived from correctly applying actionable knowledge specific to the competition's domain. This includes the correct interpretation of data patterns based on domain context, domain-specific feature engineering, adhering to known domain constraints, or avoiding invalid assumptions that data analysis alone might not reveal.

    ### Specification for each Identified Challenge
    1. The challenge should be specific and fine-grained. Avoid general or vague statements.
    2. The challenge should be technical or methodological. Focus on design and implementation strategies that need to be solved, not simple runtime bugs (unless the bug points to a deeper architectural challenge or a persistent efficiency problem).
    3. The challenge must be strictly aligned with the improvement of the target metric.
    4. If no SOTA is available, at least one identified challenge must guide the creation of a baseline model that is feasible, potentially competitive, and able to run to completion.

    {% include "scenarios.data_science.share:scen.role" %}
    The user is improving a Kaggle competition implementation iteratively through traces. Each new trace is a modification of the State-of-the-Art (SOTA) implementation that was current at the time that trace was initiated. If a new trace's performance surpasses the SOTA it aimed to improve upon, it becomes the new SOTA. If not, it is considered a failed experiment.

    You will be provided with:
    1. A detailed competition scenario description;
    2. A history of previous successfully experiments and their associated feedbacks, indexed or ordered from oldest to newest; the latest SOTA experiment accumulates all the improvements from the previous successful experiments.
    3. A history of previous failed experiments and their associated feedbacks, chronologically ordered, where each failed experiment did not surpass the SOTA that was current at the time of its execution. The failed experiments are based on the current SOTA implementation and are used to propose hypotheses for further performance improvements.
    4. The overall current SOTA implementation and its associated feedback, which represents the best-performing experiment from the entire history provided up to this point.

    Your task is to analyze all this provided historical information and extract **Key Learnings and Unresolved Challenges** from the experiment history. These should guide concrete improvements in subsequent iterations.

    ## Key Learnings and Unresolved Challenges

    
    {% if inject_diverse %}
    ### Focus on Diversity!!
    Diversity is very critical in the analysis of scenario problems. You should closely check the history of previous experiments and feedbacks, and try to explore the problems/hypotheses that are not covered by the previous experiments.
    1. Check the previous experiments and feedbacks to find the problems that are not covered by the previous experiments.
    2. Check the current SOTA implementation and feedback to find the problems that are not covered by the current SOTA implementation.
    3. Do not do incremental exploration on the previous problems.
    {% endif %}

    ### Definition
    Key Learnings and Unresolved Challenges are specific, fine-grained technical or methodological observations, persistent issues, or patterns identified within previous experiments or the current SOTA implementation. These are primarily derived from explicit feedback, code analysis, or patterns in the trace history, and should highlight problems that need solving or learnings that should inform future hypotheses.

    ### Guidelines for Identification
    Here are guidelines to help you identify these Learnings and Challenges:

    1. **Feedback Analysis**:
      - **Explicit Issues/Suggestions as Challenges**: Extract critical issues, errors (especially those pointing to deeper problems like resource limits or incorrect submission formats if not easily fixed), or direct suggestions from feedback that represent unresolved problems.
      - **Implicit Gaps as Challenges**: Infer unaddressed points, shortcomings, or areas for improvement implied by feedback that constitute ongoing challenges.
      - **Time/Memory Constraints as Critical Challenges**: If previous experiments indicate failures due to time/memory limitations, or inefficient resource usage, this **MUST** be listed as a critical challenge. This includes identifying if the current SOTA or failed experiments are too complex for the given time limits.

    2. **Implementation Review (of SOTA or relevant past experiments)**:
      - **Suboptimal Design as Challenges**: Identify potentially suboptimal feature selection, model architecture, hyperparameters, ensemble strategy, training/validation processes that appear as recurring problems or limit performance, framing them as challenges to be addressed.
      - **Common Implementation Issues**: Note the coding issues that are blocking for receiving a reasonable result. For example, the submission format was repeatedly incorrect despite attempts to fix it, this is an unresolved challenge related to the implementation.

    3. **Trace History Analysis (Trends & Patterns as Challenges)**:
      - **Persistent Issues/Errors as Challenges**: Flag unresolved negative patterns, errors (e.g., recurrent `zipfile.BadZipFile`, CUDA label errors, submission format mismatches if they persist after attempts to fix), or suboptimal outcomes that recur across multiple experiment traces. These represent core unresolved challenges.
      - **Ineffective/Partial Fixes**: Highlight if previous changes intended to solve a problem were only partially successful or ineffective, meaning the core challenge remains.
      - **Unexplored Promising Directions**: Identify potentially valuable approaches (e.g., alternative feature sets, different model families, advanced optimization techniques) that were hinted at by feedback, briefly tried without full exploration, or represent logical next steps given the trajectory of past experiments.
      - **Constraint Violations/Inefficiencies as Challenges**: Explicitly note any unaddressed time or memory constraint violations or significant computational inefficiencies as critical challenges that need strategic solutions.

    ### Specification for each Learning/Challenge
    1. The Learning/Challenge must be specific, actionable, and evidence-based (tied to feedback, code, or trace history).
    2. It should focus on technical or methodological problems that need solving.
    3. Clearly state the learning or articulate the challenge.
    4. Addressing the challenge or applying the learning should have a plausible positive impact on the target metric or successful execution.
    5. The challenge must be strictly aligned with the improvement of the target metric.

    The user is iteratively improving a Kaggle competition implementation. Each new iteration (trace) is a modification of the current State-of-the-Art (SOTA). If a new trace surpasses the current SOTA, it becomes the new SOTA. Otherwise, it's a failed experiment.
    You will be provided with:
    1. A detailed competition scenario description.
    2. A history of previous successfully experiments and their associated feedbacks, indexed or ordered from oldest to newest; the latest SOTA experiment accumulates all the improvements from the previous successful experiments.
    3. A history of previous failed experiments and their associated feedbacks, chronologically ordered, where each failed experiment did not surpass the SOTA that was current at the time of its execution. The failed experiments are based on the current SOTA implementation and are used to propose hypotheses for further performance improvements.
    4. The current SOTA implementation and feedback (the latest successful experiment).
    5. A list of identified **Challenges** from history), which we will refer to as "Identified Challenges" below.

    Your task is to perform two main steps:
    1. **Hypothesis Proposal**: For each relevant Identified Challenge, propose one specific, testable hypothesis.
    2. **Hypothesis Evaluation**: Evaluate each proposed hypothesis across multiple dimensions.

    {% if enable_idea_pool %}
    To help you propose hypotheses, the user may provide a list of ideas for each Identified Challenge. These ideas are methods or techniques from successful SOTA implementations in other competitions.
    Evaluate these ideas: they might help address the Identified Challenges and improve the current SOTA. You must decide whether to use them. If you adapt a provided idea for a specific Challenge into your hypothesis, ensure you clearly state this by setting the 'inspired' flag to True for that hypothesis.
    {% endif %}

    # Task 1: Hypothesis Proposal
    First note that the user might provide a list of challenges containing duplicates. You should only propose one hypothesis for each unique challenge. If a challenge is a duplicate of a previous one, you can skip it.
    For each Identified Challenge, propose one hypothesis corresponding to the Challenge, aimed at improving the current SOTA implementation or establishing a robust initial SOTA.

    ## 1.1. Steps to Hypothesize
    Follow these steps to formulate effective hypotheses:

    1. **Understanding the Challenge**:
      - Analyze the Identified Challenge to understand its root cause and potential impact on the competition's target metric or successful execution.
      - If the Challenge stems from past experiments (SOTA or failed), review the specifics of those experiments to ensure the proposed hypothesis offers a novel, more effective, or correctly implemented solution.
      - If the Challenge relates to persistent problems from failed experiments (e.g., experiments consistently failed due to time/memory constraints, or recurrent errors like incorrect data loading or submission formats), your hypothesis MUST propose a direct and robust tentative solution.
    2. **Drafting the First Implementation (if no SOTA exists)**:
      - If there is no SOTA implementation yet (i.e., you are drafting the first implementation based on a foundational Challenge identified in the previous step), your primary hypothesis should focus on developing a baseline model that directly addresses the foundational Challenge and can run to completion reliably.
      - This initial hypothesis should define the core data processing, feature engineering, model choice, and submission generation steps in a clear and executable way. Avoid introducing unnecessary complexity in the first version, but you are not restricted to overly simple models—a reasonable, competitive baseline is acceptable as long as it is likely to run reliably.
    3. **Actionable Changes**:
      - If a Challenge involves underperforming models (e.g., in an ensemble), propose specific actions like removing or replacing those models.
      - If a Challenge relates to hyperparameter tuning, recommend a specific method or strategy (e.g., "Use Optuna to perform hyperparameter tuning on the LightGBM model to address the 'suboptimal hyperparameter' challenge").
      - If a Challenge points to data loading, preprocessing, or submission format errors, the hypothesis must detail the exact changes required to rectify these issues.
    {% if enable_idea_pool %}
    4. **Idea Reference**: Provided ideas are methods, techniques, or tricks from high-performing implementations in other competitions addressing similar problems. Use them as inspiration if you find them suitable for the current Challenge.
    {% endif %}

    ## 1.2. Guidelines for Writing Hypotheses

    1. **Be Specific and Decisive**:
      - Clearly state the exact, unambiguous change(s) being proposed. Avoid vague goals like "improve the model" or "optimize the pipeline."
      - The hypothesis must propose a single, clear course of action. Do not suggest alternatives (e.g., "try method A or method B").
      - The hypothesis statement must be direct and definitive, without phrases like "for example," "e.g.," or "might involve."
      - The hypothesis must be more informative and decisive than the Challenge it addresses. It should not simply restate the Challenge or suggest a general approach without specifics.
    2. **Ensure Testability and Actionability**:
      - The hypothesis must describe an action or change that can be practically implemented and tested.
      - If the hypothesis is about improving SOTA, it should clearly state the expected improvement, typically related to a measurable performance metric or successful execution.
      - If the hypothesis is about establishing the first solution, it should clearly outline the expected outcome -- RUNNABILITY and CORRECTNESS. Prioritize getting a valid submission out, even with a very basic model or pipeline.
    3. **Align with Current SOTA and Identified Challenges**:
      - The hypothesis must be directly relevant to improving the *current* State-of-the-Art (SOTA) implementation or establishing a new SOTA if none exists.
      - It must directly address one of the `Identified Challenges` provided as input.
    4. **Maintain Singular Focus within Hypothesis**:
      - If a hypothesis involves multiple adjustments, these must be tightly correlated and contribute to a single, unified conceptual change addressing the core of the Identified Challenge.
      - Avoid bundling multiple independent or unrelated ideas into a single hypothesis. Each hypothesis should test one core concept.
    5. **Address the Overall Pipeline (for Pipeline-Focused Tasks)**:
      - The hypothesis should address improvements to the end-to-end pipeline.
      - It can propose coordinated changes across multiple parts of the SOTA implementation if these are necessary to achieve a significant pipeline-level improvement to address the Challenge. (Note: Even for pipeline-focused hypotheses, you will still select the single *most relevant* primary component tag during the evaluation task.)

    # Task 2: Hypothesis Evaluation
    After proposing one hypothesis for each relevant Identified Challenge, evaluate each one.

    ## 2.1. Evaluation Instruction
    For each individual hypothesis you proposed in Task 1, perform the following two evaluation steps:

    1. **Assign a Component Tag:** Assign a single component tag to the hypothesis. Choose the **single most relevant** tag from the official list below, even if the hypothesis appears to touch upon multiple areas. Use the following detailed descriptions to understand the scope and boundaries of each component.

      - **`DataLoadSpec`**: Responsible for loading raw competition data, ensuring data is converted to the correct types, and potentially providing an initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) summary. (e.g., fixing `zipfile.BadZipFile` by improving loading logic).
      - **`FeatureEng`**: Focuses on transforming raw data into meaningful features suitable for model consumption. Key responsibilities include maintaining data shape consistency, preventing data leakage during feature creation, and optimizing features for model performance. Feature engineering should be model-agnostic.
      - **`Model`**: Involves model building (developing new models to address the problem), model tuning (optimizing existing models for better performance), or model removal. This component also handles data operations or augmentations closely tied to a specific model framework (e.g., PyTorch `Datasets` & `DataLoaders`, TensorFlow `tf.data`, or fixing CUDA label errors by ensuring correct label mapping before loss calculation).
      - **`Ensemble`**: Combines predictions from multiple models using various ensemble strategies.
      - **`Workflow`**: Integrates all pipeline components, orchestrating the flow from data loading through to final output generation (e.g., correcting `submission.csv` column names or structure, managing overall pipeline execution logic for efficiency).

    2. **Score the Hypothesis:** For each hypothesis, provide a score from 1 (lowest/worst) to 10 (highest/best) on each of the following five dimensions. Base your scores on all provided information.
      - **Challenge-Hypothesis Alignment (Score: 1-10):** How directly and effectively does the hypothesis address the core issues of the `Identified Challenge` it targets? A higher score means a stronger, more direct alignment.
      - **Expected Impact (Score: 1-10):** What is the estimated magnitude of improvement (e.g., in the primary competition metric, efficiency, robustness, or successful execution) if this hypothesis is successfully implemented? Higher scores for greater positive impact.
      - **Novelty (Score: 1-10):** How innovative or original is this hypothesis when compared to the approaches and ideas evident in the `previous SOTA experiments` and `previous failed experiments`? Assign a score of 1 if the hypothesis is a repeat or substantially similar to a previously attempted hypothesis (whether successful or failed), UNLESS the previous attempt clearly failed due to a trivial implementation bug and the current hypothesis proposes the correct implementation of the same core idea.
      - **Feasibility (Score: 1-10):** How easily and practically can this hypothesis be implemented and *run to completion* within the existing SOTA codebase and operational constraints (e.g., allowed time for training/inference, available compute resources, overall complexity)? Higher scores for easier implementation and higher likelihood of successful execution.
      - **Risk-Reward Balance (Score: 1-10):** Considering the potential for significant improvement (reward) versus the probability of failure, negative side-effects, or excessive resource consumption (risk), how optimal is this balance? A high score indicates a favorable balance.
      - **Prioritization for Critical Challenges:** If a hypothesis directly and credibly addresses a **critical Challenge that caused prior experiment failures** (e.g., timeout, persistent data loading errors, incorrect submission format preventing any score), its **Expected Impact** and **Risk-Reward Balance** should generally be scored highly (e.g., 8-10), and **Feasibility** should also be high if the proposed solution is indeed simpler, more direct, or more efficient. This ensures such critical hypotheses are prioritized.

    The user is iteratively developing a Kaggle competition solution. Each new iteration aims to improve upon the current State-of-the-Art (SOTA) implementation by applying a specific hypothesis that addresses an identified challenge. The new trace is based on the current SOTA; the SOTA itself evolves.

    You will be provided with the following inputs:
    1. **Competition Scenario Description**: Details about the competition (task type, data, evaluation metric, time limits, etc.).
    2. **Current SOTA Implementation & Feedback**: (If available) Details of the best-performing solution so far. **If no SOTA implementation is provided, your primary task is to sketch a reasonable end-to-end `main.py` workflow.**
    3. **Proposed Hypothesis**: One, or more specific hypotheses aimed at improving the current SOTA or forming the basis of an initial SOTA. This hypothesis directly addresses an "Identified Challenge" from a previous analysis step.
    4. **Previous Failed Experiments & Feedback**: (If available) A history of unsuccessful attempts, which are crucial for learning. The failed experiments are based on the current SOTA implementation and are used to propose hypotheses for further performance improvements.

    Your primary goal is to generate a detailed, step-by-step **sketch or refinement plan** for a new data processing and modeling pipeline, specifically for the main workflow script (`main.py`), that effectively implements the `Proposed Hypothesis`. This sketch will guide a developer to write the code correctly.

    # BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Pipeline Implementation Standards & Constraints

    The `main.py` sketch you generate should lead to a pipeline implementation that adheres to the following standards. These are guiding principles for the final *outcome* of your sketch:

    1. **Program Execution**: The resulting `main.py` script must be executable via `python main.py` without command-line parameters. Configurations should be hardcoded for simplicity.
    2. **File Handling**:
      - Implement robust handling of file encodings and delimiters.
      - Input files are under `{% include "scenarios.data_science.share:scen.input_path" %}`. The sketch must detail how they are loaded and, if multiple, combined or processed.
      - Test indices must be determined from a dedicated test index file (if available) or by the order in the test data file. **Crucially, DO NOT use the sample submission file to infer test indices or the number of test samples.**
      - Ensure actual data (not just filenames) is loaded during the data loading phase.
      - If data is in zip files, the sketch should advise on robust loading, e.g., pre-extraction or careful handling if using multiprocessing in data loaders.
    3. **Data Preprocessing**:
      - Convert data to correct types (numeric, categorical, parse dates).
      - Optimize memory usage (e.g., downcasting, chunk processing if essential and the hypothesis supports it).
      - Implement domain-specific preprocessing relevant to the hypothesis (e.g., text tokenization, image resizing/augmentation).
    4. **Code Standards**:
      - The pipeline must **NOT** use progress bars (e.g., `tqdm`) in the submission code.
      - Reiterate: **DO NOT** use the sample submission file to extract test indices or any other information beyond the required column names and format for the output file.
      - Ensure no features are inadvertently excluded during processing.
    5. **General Data Science Considerations**:
      - Design for scalability.
      - Handle missing values and outliers appropriately as guided by the hypothesis or SOTA.
      - Ensure consistency between feature data types and any transformations applied.
      - Prevent data leakage from test/validation sets into any training stage.
    6. **Resource Utilization**: Leverage GPU and multiprocessing where appropriate and beneficial, if consistent with the hypothesis and efficiency goals.
    7. **Metric Calculation and Storage (`scores.csv`)**:
      - Calculate the official competition metric on a proper validation set. Save results to `scores.csv`.
      - The sketch must ensure this step is included. A successful run should always produce scores.
      - `scores.csv` must have an index with model names and the literal string "ensemble" (lowercase). Columns should be the exact metric name (e.g., "AUC").
      - When only one model is used, its score should be present, and an "ensemble" score (which would be the same as the single model's score in this case) must also be recorded.
      - Ensure validation metrics and processes are consistent across all parts of the pipeline. Avoid changes that would alter how validation metrics are calculated unless that is part of the hypothesis.
    8. **Submission File (`submission.csv`)**: Generate `submission.csv` in the **exact format** required (column names, order, data types), as detailed by `sample_submission.csv` in the `Competition Scenario Description`. This is a critical step.
    9. **Preferred Packages Notes**:
      - You can choose the most proper packages for the task to best achieve the hypothesis.
      - When facing a choice between two packages which both can achieve the same goal, you should choose the one which is more commonly used and less likely to cause bugs in coding. Especially those you are not familiar with.
      - For GBDT models, prefer XGBoost or RandomForest over LightGBM unless the SOTA or hypothesis dictates otherwise.
      - For neural networks, prefer PyTorch or PyTorch based library (over TensorFlow) unless the SOTA or hypothesis dictates otherwise.
      - For neural networks, prefer fine-tuning pre-trained models over training from scratch.

    # Guidelines for Sketching the `main.py` Workflow

    YOUR TASK IS TO create a conceptual sketch for drafting or updating the `main.py` workflow. This is a plan, not code.

    1. **No Code**: The sketch **MUST NOT** contain any programming code, specific library calls, or pseudo-code. Describe steps conceptually (e.g., "Load training data from {% include "scenarios.data_science.share:scen.input_path" %}/train.csv"). List specific algorithm names where appropriate (e.g., "Apply XGBoost classifier," "Use Isotonic Regression for calibration").
    2. **Structure and Conciseness**:
      - If SOTA exists, understand its structure first.
      - If no SOTA, outline a clear, logical sequence of steps for the new `main.py`.
    3. **Leverage SOTA or Design a New One**:
      - **If a `Current SOTA Implementation` is provided**: Your sketch must primarily detail the **minimal and targeted changes, additions, or replacements** needed to integrate the `Proposed Hypothesis` into that SOTA. Focus only on what needs to change.
      - **If NO `Current SOTA Implementation` is provided (Initial Version)**: This is critical. Your sketch **MUST** describe a **COMPLETE, END-TO-END, REASONABLE baseline pipeline**.
        - It must cover: Data loading (from specified paths), essential preprocessing (as per hypothesis or minimal viable), a basic model implementation (as per hypothesis), a simple validation strategy (e.g., a single train-validation split or fewer folds if CV is too complex initially), generation of `scores.csv`, and `submission.csv` in the correct format.
        - The overriding goal for this initial sketch is **RUNNABILITY and CORRECTNESS of the pipeline structure**. Prioritize getting a valid submission out, even with a very basic model. Avoid any complexity not absolutely mandated by the core hypothesis or competition basics.
    4. **Learn from Past Failures**:
      - If `Previous Failed Experiments & Feedback` are provided, analyze them meticulously. Design the sketch to explicitly avoid repeating similar mistakes, especially if failures relate to the current hypothesis, data handling, submission format, or resource usage (timeouts).
      - If a hypothesis aims to fix a past failure, the sketch should detail precisely how the fix is implemented.
    5. **Specificity and Clarity**:
      - Be unambiguous. Instead of "select model," if the hypothesis implies "Train an EfficientNet-B0 model," state that.
      - The sketch must be definitive. No open-ended options or phrases like "for example," or "e.g.," within a step's action.
    6. **Resource Constraints & Efficiency**:
      - Always design the workflow to execute within the competition `Time Limit`.
      - If `Previous Failed Experiments` explicitly state time/memory constraint issues, your sketch **MUST** make efficiency the **TOP PRIORITY**. Clearly state `[EFFICIENCY AS TOP PRIORITY]` at the beginning of your sketch.
      - The sketch must then detail *specific measures* to achieve this.
      - Even if the `Proposed Hypothesis` is not about efficiency, if past experiments failed due to timeouts or the dataset/model is complex, the sketch **must still incorporate measures to improve overall pipeline efficiency**. This might involve simplifying aspects unrelated to the core hypothesis to ensure the hypothesis can be tested within limits.
      - The goal is a workflow that successfully implements and validates the `Proposed Hypothesis` effectively, balancing performance with strict resource constraints. An experiment that times out provides no information.
      - If you plan to prioritize efficiency, you can modify the parts which is not related to the hypothesis. Which means your task should still able to validate the hypothesis.
      - Add [EFFICIENCY AS PRIORITY] tag in the task description to indicate that the task takes efficiency as a priority.
      - Although the task should prioritize efficiency, it should not be the only focus. The task should also be aligned with the proposed hypothesis and the current SOTA implementation.
    7. **Reminders of Common Mistakes (Especially for New `main.py`)**: At the end of your sketch, include a "Key Reminders for Developer" section. Add the following reminders if appropriate.
      - Ensure all input files are loaded from their exact paths under `{% include "scenarios.data_science.share:scen.input_path" %}` (e.g., `{% include "scenarios.data_science.share:scen.input_path" %}<competition_name>/train.csv`)."
      - Verify `submission.csv` strictly adheres to format: columns, correct data types, and no extra index.
      - "Implement correct label mapping for classification tasks (e.g., 0-indexed, contiguous integers for loss functions like PyTorch's CrossEntropyLoss) to prevent runtime errors."
      - Handle file I/O robustly, especially for zipped data or large files, to prevent `FileNotFoundError` or `BadZipFile` issues.
      - Confirm no `tqdm` or other progress bars are in the final script.
      - Double-check that validation scores are saved correctly to `scores.csv` with specified 'Model' and metric columns, even for a single model run (include 'ensemble' row).
    8. **EDA improvement**: The user might provide you some EDA improvement suggestions based on the previous EDA output. If so, you should also include the EDA improvement in your sketch.

    # Hyperparameters Specification
    Follow the hyperparameters specification below when approaching hyperparameter selection.
    If you are confident in a specific value based on strong evidence, prior experiments, or clear rationale, specify the value clearly.
    {% include "scenarios.data_science.share:spec.hyperparameter" %}

    
    {% if task_output_format is not none %}

    # Output Format

    {% if not workflow_check %}

    {{ task_output_format }}

    {% else %}

    There are two steps in the task. But you should adhere to the final output format.

    ## [Partial Response Format 1]
    ### Step1: **Task Output Format** :
    {{ task_output_format }}

    ### Step 2: **Workflow Update** :
    Since components have dependencies, your second task is to update the workflow to reflect the changes made to the target component. Please also decide whether the workflow needs to be updated and provide a brief description of the change task.
    {{ component_desc }}

    ## [Partial Response Format 2] Your generated workflow description should be a simple text and the following agent will do the implementation. If you think the workflow should not be updated, just respond with "No update needed".

    At last, your final output should strictly adhere to the following JSON format. 
    {
      "task_design": a dict which strictly adheres to the **Task Output Format** in Step 1,
      "workflow_update": "A string which is a precise and comprehensive description of the Workflow Update, or 'No update needed' if no changes are required."

idea_sample:
  system: |-
    You are a Kaggle Grandmaster and expert ML engineer with deep expertise in statistics, machine learning, and competition optimization.
    The user is improving a Kaggle competition implementation iteratively through traces where each new trace is modified from the current SOTA in the trace, not necessarily the immediate predecessor.
    You will be given a competition scenario, previous SOTA and failed experiments and feedbacks, and the current SOTA implementation and feedback.
    The user has identified potential problems in the current SOTA implementation and sampled few ideas for possible improvement direction for each of the problem.
    Your task is to identify the most useful and potential idea for each of the problem according to the impact, alignment, and novelty of the ideas.

    The user provided ideas might not be the suitable solution for the identified problems. If all ideas to one problem are not useful, please ignore this problem in your response dict.

specification:
  hypothesis: |-
    1. Each hypothesis should be specific and non-vague.
      - Avoid vague statements like "improve the model" or "optimize the pipeline." Instead, specify the exact changes to be made. Do not use ambiguous changes like "try method A or method B". 
      - No phrases like "for example" or "eg.," should be used in the hypothesis. Give a clear decision in the hypothesis.
    2. Each hypothesis should be testable and actionable. It should clearly state the expected change or improvement in the component's performance. For example, "tuning a model" is too broad, whereas "increasing the learning rate to 0.1 in the LightGBM model will improve performance" is testable and actionable.
    3. Each hypothesis should be aligned with the current SOTA implementation. It should be a potential solution to the identified problem.
    4. All the changes in the hypothesis should be correlated and relevant to each other. Avoid proposing multiple independent ideas in a single hypothesis.
    {% if not pipeline %}5. Each hypothesis should focus on a single direction per experiment. Avoid proposing multiple possibilities within the same hypothesis, such as "this may work in case A or case B." Research and development can be approached at different levels (shallow or deep), but each experimental loop should validate only one specific idea.
    6. Each hypothesis should focus on one component. The components will be described in the evaluation stage.
    {% else %}5. The hypothesis should focus on the whole pipeline. If needed, the hypothesis may propose changes across multiple parts in the SOTA implementation.
    {% endif %}

  idea: |-
    1. Alignment: The idea should be aligned with the identified problem. It should be a potential solution to the problem.
    2. Novelty: The idea should be novel and not previously explored in the current SOTA implementation. Avoid ideas that have already been tried and failed.
    3. Impact: The idea should have the potential to significantly improve the current SOTA implementation. It should be a promising direction for further exploration.
    4. You should identify the most useful and potential idea for each of the problem. If none of the provided ideas are useful, please ignore this problem in your response dict.
