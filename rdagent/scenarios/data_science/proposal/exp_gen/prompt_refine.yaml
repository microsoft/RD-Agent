    The user is improving a Kaggle competition implementation iteratively. Each new iteration (trace) is typically a modification of the current overall State-of-the-Art (SOTA) solution. If a new trace's performance surpasses the current SOTA, it establishes a new SOTA. Otherwise, it is considered a failed experiment.
  
    You will be provided with:
    1. A detailed competition scenario description.
    2. A history of previous successfully experiments and their associated feedbacks, indexed or ordered from oldest to newest; the latest SOTA experiment accumulates all the improvements from the previous successful experiments.
    3. A history of previous failed experiments and their associated feedbacks, chronologically ordered, where each failed experiment did not surpass the SOTA that was current at the time of its execution. The failed experiments are based on the current SOTA implementation and are used to propose hypotheses for further performance improvements.
    4. The current SOTA implementation and feedback (the latest successful experiment).
    5. A proposed refinement hypothesis. Previous analysis demonstrated that the current SOTA implementation is not effective enough in terms of efficiency and hyperparameters.
    
    Your goal is to generate a detailed, step-by-step **refinement plan** for current SOTA implementation that effectively implements the `Proposed Hypothesis`.

    # Implementation Specification
    The `main.py` sketch you generate should adheres to the following standards:
    1. **Program Execution**: The resulting `main.py` script must be executable via `python main.py` without command-line parameters. Configurations should be hardcoded for simplicity.
    2. **File Handling**:
      - Implement robust handling of file encodings and delimiters.
      - Input files are under `{% include "scenarios.data_science.share:scen.input_path" %}`. The sketch must detail how they are loaded and, if multiple, combined or processed.
      - Test indices must be determined from a dedicated test index file (if available) or by the order in the test data file. **Crucially, DO NOT use the sample submission file to infer test indices or the number of test samples.**
      - Ensure actual data (not just filenames) is loaded during the data loading phase.
      - If data is in zip files, the sketch should advise on robust loading, e.g., pre-extraction or careful handling if using multiprocessing in data loaders.
    3. **Data Preprocessing**:
      - Convert data to correct types (numeric, categorical, parse dates).
      - Optimize memory usage (e.g., downcasting, chunk processing if essential and the hypothesis supports it).
      - Implement domain-specific preprocessing relevant to the hypothesis (e.g., text tokenization, image resizing/augmentation).
    4. **Code Standards**:
      - The pipeline must **NOT** use progress bars (e.g., `tqdm`) in the submission code.
      - Reiterate: **DO NOT** use the sample submission file to extract test indices or any other information beyond the required column names and format for the output file.
      - Ensure no features are inadvertently excluded during processing.
    5. **Preferred Technologies & Methodological Notes**:
      - NN models: Prefer PyTorch (over TensorFlow) if no SOTA or hypothesis dictates otherwise. Prioritize fine-tuning pre-trained models.
      - Decision Tree models: Prefer XGBoost or RandomForest over LightGBM unless SOTA or hypothesis dictates otherwise.
    6. **General Data Science Considerations**:
      - Design for scalability.
      - Handle missing values and outliers appropriately as guided by the hypothesis or SOTA.
      - Ensure consistency between feature data types and any transformations applied.
      - Prevent data leakage from test/validation sets into any training stage.
    7. **Resource Utilization**: Leverage GPU and multiprocessing where appropriate and beneficial, if consistent with the hypothesis and efficiency goals.
    8. **Metric Calculation and Storage (`scores.csv`)**:
      - Calculate the official competition metric on a proper validation set. Save results to `scores.csv`.
      - The sketch must ensure this step is included. A successful run should always produce scores.
      - `scores.csv` must have an index with model names and the literal string "ensemble" (lowercase). Columns should be "Model" (the name of the model or the ensemble strategy), and the exact metric name (e.g., "AUC").
      - When only one model is used, its score should be present, and an "ensemble" score (which would be the same as the single model's score in this case) must also be recorded.
      - Ensure validation metrics and processes are consistent across all parts of the pipeline. Avoid changes that would alter how validation metrics are calculated unless that is part of the hypothesis.
    9. **Submission File (`submission.csv`)**: Generate `submission.csv` in the **exact format** required (column names, order, data types), as detailed by `sample_submission.csv` in the `Competition Scenario Description`. This is a critical step.

    # Sketching Guidelines
    Your task is to create a conceptual sketch for refining the `main.py` workflow. This is a plan, not code.
    1. **No Code**: The sketch **MUST NOT** contain any programming code, specific library calls, or pseudo-code. Describe steps conceptually (e.g., "Load training data from {% include "scenarios.data_science.share:scen.input_path" %}/train.csv"). List specific algorithm names where appropriate (e.g., "Apply XGBoost classifier," "Use Isotonic Regression for calibration").
    2. **Structure and Conciseness**:
      - If SOTA exists, understand its structure first.
      - If no SOTA, outline a clear, logical sequence of steps for the new `main.py`.
    3. **Leverage SOTA or Design a New One**:
      - **If a `Current SOTA Implementation` is provided**: Your sketch must primarily detail the **minimal and targeted changes, additions, or replacements** needed to integrate the `Proposed Hypothesis` into that SOTA. Focus only on what needs to change.
      - **If NO `Current SOTA Implementation` is provided (Initial Version)**: This is critical. Your sketch **MUST** describe a **COMPLETE, END-TO-END, YET SIMPLEST POSSIBLE baseline pipeline**.
        - It must cover: Data loading (from specified paths), essential preprocessing (as per hypothesis or minimal viable), a basic model implementation (as per hypothesis), a simple validation strategy (e.g., a single train-validation split or fewer folds if CV is too complex initially), generation of `scores.csv`, and `submission.csv` in the correct format.
        - The overriding goal for this initial sketch is **RUNNABILITY and CORRECTNESS of the pipeline structure**. Prioritize getting a valid submission out, even with a very basic model. Avoid any complexity not absolutely mandated by the core hypothesis or competition basics.
    4. **Learn from Past Failures**:
      - If `Previous Failed Experiments & Feedback` are provided, analyze them meticulously. Design the sketch to explicitly avoid repeating similar mistakes, especially if failures relate to the current hypothesis, data handling, submission format, or resource usage (timeouts).
      - If a hypothesis aims to fix a past failure, the sketch should detail precisely how the fix is implemented.
    5. **Specificity and Clarity**:
      - Be unambiguous. Instead of "select model," if the hypothesis implies "Train an EfficientNet-B0 model," state that.
      - The sketch must be definitive. No open-ended options or phrases like "for example," or "e.g.," within a step's action.
    6. **Resource Constraints & Efficiency**:
      - Always design the workflow to execute within the competition `Time Limit`.
      - If `Previous Failed Experiments` explicitly state time/memory constraint issues, your sketch **MUST** make efficiency the **TOP PRIORITY**. Clearly state `[EFFICIENCY AS TOP PRIORITY]` at the beginning of your sketch.
      - The sketch must then detail *specific measures* to achieve this (e.g., "Reduce CV folds to 2," "Limit training to 3 epochs," "Use a smaller pre-trained model like MobileNetV2," "Subsample training data to 50% if full dataset causes timeout").
      - Even if the `Proposed Hypothesis` is not about efficiency, if past experiments failed due to timeouts or the dataset/model is complex, the sketch **must still incorporate measures to improve overall pipeline efficiency**. This might involve simplifying aspects unrelated to the core hypothesis (e.g., reducing image resolution, simpler feature engineering) to ensure the hypothesis can be tested within limits.
      - The goal is a workflow that successfully implements and validates the `Proposed Hypothesis` effectively, balancing performance with strict resource constraints. An experiment that times out provides no information.
      - If you plan to prioritize efficiency, you can modify the parts which is not related to the hypothesis. Which means your task should still able to validate the hypothesis.
      - Add [EFFICIENCY AS PRIORITY] tag in the task description to indicate that the task takes efficiency as a priority.
      - Although the task should prioritize efficiency, it should not be the only focus. The task should also be aligned with the proposed hypothesis and the current SOTA implementation.
    7. **Reminders of Common Mistakes (Especially for New `main.py`)**: At the end of your sketch, include a "Key Reminders for Developer" section. Add the following reminders if appropriate.
      - Ensure all input files are loaded from their exact paths under `{% include "scenarios.data_science.share:scen.input_path" %}` (e.g., `{% include "scenarios.data_science.share:scen.input_path" %}<competition_name>/train.csv`)."
      - Verify `submission.csv` strictly adheres to format: columns, correct data types, and no extra index.
      - "Implement correct label mapping for classification tasks (e.g., 0-indexed, contiguous integers for loss functions like PyTorch's CrossEntropyLoss) to prevent runtime errors."
      - Handle file I/O robustly, especially for zipped data or large files, to prevent `FileNotFoundError` or `BadZipFile` issues.
      - Confirm no `tqdm` or other progress bars are in the final script.
      - Double-check that validation scores are saved correctly to `scores.csv` with specified 'Model' and metric columns, even for a single model run (include 'ensemble' row).
