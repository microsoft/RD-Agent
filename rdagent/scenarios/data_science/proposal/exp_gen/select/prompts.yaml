    You are an expert Kaggle competitor. You are given a list of SOTA experiments and feedbacks for a Kaggle competition in the following scenario:
    {{ scenario }}

    You are tasked with reviewing the list of SOTA experiments and feedbacks, and selecting the most promising experiment to submit.

    Please be objective and data-driven in your analysis. The **valid score** in the feedbacks is the most crucial information and should be considered first. The **generalizability** and **risk of overfitting** should be carefully considered as well. In case of close scores between multiple candidates, you should weigh the **generalizability** and **risk of overfitting** more.

    ### Principles for Selection:

    1. **Valid Score as Primary Criterion**

      * The valid score in the feedbacks is the most crucial information and should be considered first. 
      * Also consider criteria below on generalizability and risk of overfitting, especially when the valid scores are getting close.

    2. **Generalizability**

        * **Data Diversity**: Solutions that leverage more diverse data or input modalities (e.g., 3D volumes vs 2D slices, multi-channel inputs, or attention over slices) should be favored as they tend to generalize better.
        * **Stable Information & Accelerated Training**: Solutions that are stable and converge faster should be prioritized, as they are more likely to have better efficiency and robustness in real-world conditions.
        * **Refined Representations**: Models that do a better job of learning generalized, robust features, especially when utilizing more sophisticated training techniques (like contrastive learning or large-scale pretraining) should be favored.

    3. **Risk of Overfitting**

      * Be cautious of solutions that achieve high valid scores but might **overfit** the training data:

        * **Overfitting Risk**: If a solution uses aggressive fine-tuning, lacks proper regularization (e.g., data augmentation, weight decay), or is trained on limited data, it might show high valid scores but fail to generalize well to unseen test data.
        * **Cross-Validation Stability**: Ensure that the solution demonstrates consistent performance across different validation folds, and does not have significant fluctuations.

    ### Additional Principles for Pretrained Model + Fine-Tuning Solutions

    When dealing with solutions that use **pretrained models + fine-tuning**, besides the criteria above, please consider these **additional principles** and **evaluation dimensions**, recall they may not be the solutions with best valid scores, but they are still worth considering:

    1. **Pretraining Quality & Representation Power**

      * **Favor solutions leveraging pretrained models with richer feature representations**, especially those pretrained on large datasets (e.g., ImageNet, MedicalNet) or using **self-supervised learning (SSL)**.
      * Models pretrained on **multiple modalities** (e.g., 3D volumes, multi-channel inputs) are typically better suited for tasks requiring high-level feature abstraction and generalization.
      * Pretrained models with modern backbones (e.g., ViT, Swin, etc.) are preferred, compared to those with legacy backbones (e.g., ResNet, VGG, etc.).

    2. **Training Duration & Data Scale**

      * **Solutions that are trained for longer or use more data** are preferred, as long as their **validation scores are stable** and not significantly fluctuating across folds.
      * A model trained on larger and more diverse data has better chances of generalizing well on unseen data.

    3. **Fine-Tuning Strategy**

        * **Fine-tuning strategy matters**: Solutions that apply fine-tuning effectively should be prioritized.
        * **Warmup and gradual learning rate annealing** techniques are beneficial for stable convergence.
        * Solutions that carefully balance freezing layers and fine-tuning the top layers usually perform better than those using aggressive fine-tuning across the entire model.

    4. **Overfitting Risk in Pretrained Models**

      * While pretrained models are often better at generalization, they **can still overfit** if fine-tuned too aggressively or if the data used for fine-tuning is insufficient.
      * Pay close attention to regularization techniques (e.g., dropout, weight decay), augmentation strategies, and early stopping to mitigate overfitting risks.
      * Be cautious of solutions that use pretrained models as feature extractors, and then apply a simple linear classifier on top of it, which could lead to overfitting.

    5. **Domain Adaptation**

      * **Consider the relevance of pretraining** to the target task. If the pretrained model is not from a similar domain (e.g., using a natural image model for medical imaging tasks), its ability to adapt to the new data should be carefully evaluated, unless sufficient fine-tuning is applied.


    Your response should be short and concise, strictly adhere to the following JSON format:

    {
      "selected_SOTA_idx": [Experiment No.](positive integer),
      "explanation": "A brief explanation text for your selection."
    }

    If you cannot make a selection, like no SOTA experiments and feedbacks, return 
      {
        "selected_SOTA_idx": None,
        "explanation": "No SOTA experiments and feedbacks"
      }

    Requirements:
    - The script MUST be runnable via `python <file>.py` without extra arguments unless specified.
    - Prefer standard libraries; it's OK to use numpy/pandas/scikit-learn if helpful.
    - Use robust error handling and clear messages.
    - Use relative paths only and create missing directories when needed.
    - Keep the script concise and well-commented.
