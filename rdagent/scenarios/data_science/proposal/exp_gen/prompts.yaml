    # Step1: Hypothesis Proposal
    The user has already proposed several hypotheses and conducted evaluations on them. This information will be provided to you later.

    ## Hypothesis Specification
    To assist you in formulating new hypotheses, the user has provided some additional information: 
    {{ hypothesis_specification }}

    ## Guidelines
    Important: If the Hypothesis Specification outlines the next steps you need to follow, ensure you adhere to those instructions.

    [Partial Response Format 1] Your generated output should contain key-value pairs adhering to the following format and specifications:
    {{ hypothesis_output_format }}
    Also generate the relevant keys for the reasoning and the distilled knowledge that follows. For those keys, in particular for knowledge, explain in the context of the specific scenario to build up domain knowledge in the specific field rather than general knowledge.

    # Step2: Task Design

    The user is trying to generate new {{ targets }} based on the hypothesis generated in the previous step.

    ## Task Specification
    The scope of the {{ targets }} can be described by a interface specification as follows:
    ```markdown
    {{ task_specification }}
    ```

    ## Guidelines
    The user will use the {{ targets }} generated to do some experiments. The user will provide this information to you:
    1. The target hypothesis you are targeting to generate {{ targets }} for.
    2. The hypothesis generated in the previous steps and their corresponding feedbacks.
    3. Former proposed {{ targets }} on similar hypothesis.
    4. Some additional information to help you generate new {{ targets }}.

    [Partial Response Format 2] Your generated output should contain key-value pairs adhering to the following format and specifications:
    {{ task_output_format }}

    {% if workflow_check %}
    # Step3: Workflow update
    Since components have dependencies, the workflow should be updated to reflect the changes made to the target component. Please also decide whether the workflow needs to be updated and provide a brief description of the change task.
    [Partial Response Format 3] Your generated workflow description should be a simple text and the following agent will do the implementation. If you think the workflow should not be updated, just respond with "No update needed".
    {% endif %}

    Your response should contain two parts: the hypothesis proposal and the task design. Please follow the format and specifications provided below:

    Based on the feedback from previous experiment failures, if the failure was due to exceeding the time limit or memory constraints, start with the smallest model size or choose alternative algorithms or methods with significantly lower time or space complexity instead of using a neural network. You can then iteratively refine and optimize the model in later stages.

    Here is the SOTA solution:
    {{ sota_exp_desc }}
    Pay attention to the **Results** section. If there are sufficient models available and there is a model with a significantly worse score, consider removing that model. In this case, `model_name` in task_design should be the model you are going to remove (the name must be the same as the name in the model column in the **Results** section), and `description` should start with "Model removal".
    
    Otherwise, if the number of available models is insufficient. Your task is to first decide whether to:
      a. Tune an existing model: Select one of the current models for further tuning and improvement.
      b. Add a new model: Introduce a new model to expand the hypothesis space.

    The information of the model is described by the code of workspace.

    Then, based on your decision, proceed with the corresponding actions accordingly:
      a. If you decide to tune an existing model, select the existing model file and generate a new hypothesis.
      b. If you decide to add a new model, specify the type of model you would add and generate a new hypothesis related to the new model.

    When building the model, if the runtime permits, consider incorporating hyperparameter search methods to improve performance.

  2. Each hypothesis should focus on a single direction per experiment. Avoid proposing multiple possibilities within the same hypothesis, such as "this may work in case A or case B." Research and development can be approached at different levels (shallow or deep), but each experimental loop should validate only one specific idea.
  3. The hypothesis should based on current SOTA solution. The user will conduct experiments based on the SOTA solution to test whether the hypothesis improves performance in this specific competition.
