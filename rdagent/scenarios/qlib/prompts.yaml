model_hypothesis_specification: |-
  1. First, observe and analyze the overall experimental progression in `hypothesis_and_feedback`. Analyze where the previous model designs were inadequate â€” whether it was due to parameter settings, architectural flaws, or a lack of novelty (proposing entirely new concepts is highly encouraged as long as they demonstrate effectiveness).
  2. Second, `last_hypothesis_and_feedback` and `sota_hypothesis_and_feedback` are key references you should pay close attention to. You can choose to optimize based on either of them or generate new ideas to form hypotheses and experiments.
  3. If there is no prior experiment or result available at the beginning, you can start by implementing a simple and small architecture.
  4. If a series of attempts fail to achieve SOTA, consider exploring entirely new directions; at this point, it is acceptable to return to simple architectures.
  5. Focus exclusively on the architecture of PyTorch models. Each hypothesis should specifically address architectural decisions, such as layer configurations, activation functions, regularization methods, and overall model structure. DO NOT do any feature-specific processing. Instead, you can propose innovative transformations on the input time-series data to enhance model training effectiveness.
  6. Avoid including aspects unrelated to architecture, such as input features or optimization strategies.
  7. Sometimes, when training performance is poor, adjusting hyperparameters can also be an effective strategy for improvement.
  8. Use standard libraries for baseline models, but also explore custom architecture designs to investigate novel structures. After sufficient trials with traditional models, aim for innovation comparable to top-tier AI conferences (NeurIPS, ICLR, ICML, SIGKDD, etc.) in time series modeling.

factor_hypothesis_specification: |-
  1. **1-5 Factors per Generation:**
    - Ensure each generation produces 1-5 factors.
    - Balance simplicity and complexity to build a robust factor library.
    - Make full use of the financial data provided to you instead of focusing solely on a specific field.
  2. **Simple and Effective Factors First:**
    - Start with factors that are simple, easy to achieve and likely effective.
    - Concisely explain why these factors are expected to work.
    - Avoid complex or combined factors initially.
  3. **Gradual Complexity Increase:**
    - Introduce more complex factors (e.g. machine learning based factors, factors use mult-dimentional factor raw data, etc.) as more experimental results are gathered.
    - Combine factors only after simpler ones are tested and validated.
  4. **New Directions and Optimizations:**
    - If multiple consecutive iterations fail to produce factors surpassing SOTA, consider switching to a new direction and can starting with simple factors again.
    - If optimizing a specific type of factor, proceed from simple to complex.
  5. Note
    - Highlight that factors surpassing SOTA are included in the library to avoid re-implementation.

    You are a professional financial result analysis assistant in data-driven R&D. 
    The task is described in the following scenario:

    {{ scenario }}
    
    You will receive a hypothesis, multiple tasks with their factors, their results, and the SOTA result. 
    Your feedback should specify whether the current result supports or refutes the hypothesis, compare it with previous SOTA (State of the Art) results, and suggest improvements or new directions.
    
    Please understand the following operation logic and then make your feedback that is suitable for the scenario:
      1. Logic Explanation:
        a) All factors that have surpassed SOTA in previous attempts will be included in the SOTA factor library.
        b) New experiments will generate new factors, which will be combined with the factors in the SOTA library.
        c) These combined factors will be backtested and compared against the current SOTA to enable continuous iteration.
      2. Development Directions:
        a) New Direction: Propose a new factor direction for exploration and development.
        b) Optimization of Existing Direction:
          - Suggest further improvements to that factor (this can include further optimization of the factor or proposing a direction that combines better with the factor).
          - Avoid re-implementing previous factors as those that surpassed SOTA are already included in the factor library and will be used in each run.
      3. Final Goal: To continuously accumulate factors that surpass each iteration to maintain the best SOTA.
    
    When judging the results:
      1. Any small improvement should be considered for inclusion as SOTA (set `Replace Best Result` as yes).
      2. If the new factor(s) shows an improvement in the annualized return, recommend it to replace the current best result.
      3. Minor variations in other metrics are acceptable as long as the annualized return improves.

    Consider Changing Direction for Significant Gaps with SOTA:
      - If the new results significantly differ from the SOTA, consider exploring a new direction (write new type factors).
      - Avoid re-implementing previous factors as those that surpassed SOTA are already included in the factor library and will be used in each run.

    Please provide detailed and constructive feedback for future exploration.
