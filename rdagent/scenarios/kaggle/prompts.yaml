hypothesis_specification: |-
  There are different types of hypothesis that correspond to different types of actions. The specifications are quite important here:
  1) feature_engineering:
  description: We engineer the features for the sake of best model performance on the basis of engineering the most influential features.
  type_of_feature_and_data_characteristics:
    - Clearly define the feature type being introduced.
    - Highlight the specific data patterns or characteristics the feature captures.
    - Keep it focused—omit unnecessary details.
  start_with_simple_features:
    - Begin with straightforward and impactful features.
    - Briefly explain why these features are expected to work.
    - Avoid combining complex features at the outset.
  increase_complexity_gradually:
    - Add more complex features only after gathering experimental results.
    - Discuss potential advantages and the trade-offs involved.
    - Combine features only after simpler ones are tested and validated.
  new_directions_and_optimizations:
    - Justify any new direction based on data analysis or domain knowledge.
    - Focus on one new direction at a time for clarity.
    - If a hypothesis shows optimization potential (even without surpassing previous best results), explain why and proceed.
  feature_library_and_task_management:
    - Include features that improve performance in the feature library.
    - Each generation should focus on 1-3 feature tasks, balancing simplicity with complexity.

  2) feature processing:
  define_the_processing_method:
    - Clearly state the type of feature processing.
    - Explain how this processing captures data patterns or improves feature usefulness.
    - Avoid redundant details.
  begin_with_simple_processing:
    - Start with simple, effective processing methods.
    - Concisely explain why these methods should improve model performance.
    - Introduce complex processing only after gathering experimental results.
  introduce_complexity_gradually:
    - Add more sophisticated processing methods step-by-step, after validation.
    - Discuss the advantages, challenges, and trade-offs of advanced processing.
    - Validate simpler methods before combining them with complex ones.

  3) model feature selection:
  selection_based_on_model_type:
    - Specify which features are being selected and explain why, considering the model type (e.g., NN, Random Forest, LightGBM, XGBoost).
    - Ensure the relationship between features and the model type is well-defined, as different features perform better on different models.
  pattern_recognition:
    - Explain the data characteristics or patterns that influenced feature selection for the specific model.
    - Clarify how the selected features complement the model's strengths and handle its potential weaknesses.

  4) model_design_and_tuning:
  Explain the hypothesis clearly with valuable information. What kind of model are you building/tuning? What do you think is true? How you are revising and why? What are some innvations? 
  focus_on_architecture_or_hyper_parameter_tuning_or_both:
    - Focus on designing new model architectures one at a time OR hyper-parameter tuning OR both.
    - Each hypothesis should introduce a novel architecture or a significant modification to an existing one, while leveraging previous experiences and the hypothesis history.
    - Optimize one model at a time, iterating until its potential is fully explored. Switch to a new model only when you believe the current model’s potential has been exhausted.
  specific_to_model_type:
    - Note that any types of tuning or model design must be specific to the model types available in our workspace.
    - Clearly define the model type (e.g., Neural Network Models (eg, MLP, CNN, RNN, LSTM, GRU etc.), XGBoost, RandomForest, LightGBM) and the architecture/tuning being introduced.
    - Ensure the architecture or tuning aligns with the data characteristics and the strengths or limitations of the specific model.
  rationale_behind_architecture_and_tuning:
    - Explain the innovation or reasoning behind the architectural design or tuning approach.
    - Justify how the new structure or parameter change captures data patterns more effectively, improves learning efficiency, or enhances predictive power.
  start_simple_innovate_gradually:
    - Start with innovative yet simple changes to ensure each iteration is well-tested and the results are well-understood.
    - Gradually introduce more complex architectural changes or hyper-parameter adjustments based on gathered results and insights.
  introduce_one_innovation_at_a_time:
    - Focus on testing one key innovation at a time to isolate its impact on performance.
    - Avoid combining multiple innovations in a single iteration to maintain clarity in performance results.
  balance_innovation_with_performance:
    - Strive for a balance between creative design and practical, effective performance.
    - If a design or tuning shows strong performance, document it in a "library" for future iterations.
  iterative_testing_and_refinement:
    - After each test, evaluate and refine the model architecture or tuning based on observed performance and data patterns.
    - If a hypothesis shows potential but doesn't surpass previous results, continue optimizing in that direction.
  hypothesis_statement:
    - For each hypothesis, specify the exact innovation or tuning approach and explain why it's expected to enhance performance for the chosen model type.

  }

model_experiment_output_format: |-
  According to the hypothesis, please help user design one model task.
  We only build one model from four main model types: ["XGBoost", "RandomForest", "LightGBM", "NN"].
  The output should follow JSON format. The schema is as follows: 
  {
      "model_name": "model_name",
      "description": "A detailed description of the model",
      "architecture": "A detailed description of the model's architecture, e.g., neural network layers or tree structures",

          "hyperparameter_name_2": "value of hyperparameter 2",
          "hyperparameter_name_3": "value of hyperparameter 3"
      },
      "model_type": "Select only one model type: XGBoost, RandomForest, LightGBM, or NN. The primary model must be unique, but you may use auxiliary models for support if you think it can have a good result like choosing A model as the main model, with B Model used for auxiliary support or optimization on specific details."
  }
  Usually, a larger model works better than a smaller one. Hence, the parameters should be larger.

model_tuning_feedback_generation:
  system: |-
    You are an advanced assistant for analyzing results in data-driven R&D, in the context of designing machine learning models.
    The task is described in the following scenario:
    {{ scenario }}

    You will analyze the current experiment's hypothesis, model tuning code, results, and compare them with previous experiments and the best past result. 
    Your feedback should:
    1. Confirm if the current result supports or refutes the hypothesis.
    2. Compare with previous best results.
    3. Suggest improvements or new directions. Stay innovative and adapative.

    Please provide detailed and constructive feedback. Note that as hypothesis evolve, a general trend should be that the model grows larger. 
    Example JSON Structure for Result Analysis:
    {
      "Observations": "Your overall observations here",
      "Feedback for Hypothesis": "Observations related to the hypothesis",
      "New Hypothesis": "Your new hypothesis here",
      "Reasoning": "Reasoning for the new hypothesis",
      "Replace Best Result": "yes or no"
    }

    Hypothesis Evolution Logic:
    - If the current hypothesis works, make the model more complex (e.g., add layers, neurons, etc.).
    - If a hypothesis works, build on it. If not, adjust at the same level before growing deeper. Think step by step and make changes. Act innovatively. 
    - If it doesn't, modify elements at the current level (e.g., adjust regularization, change features).

    Example Hypothesis Evolution Stages: (We want hypotheses to continue growing.) Levels include **Model Type**, **Layer Configuration**, **Activation Functions**, **Regularization Techniques**, **Feature Selection Methods**...
      - Initial Hypothesis: Use CNN with no feature selection.
      - Next Level (if successful): Add 5 convolutional layers, use all features.
      - Modify (if unsuccessful): Use 3 convolutional layers, add L1 regularization for feature selection.
      - Continue Growth (if successful): Add Leaky ReLU activation to all layers, retain L1-selected features.
      - Further Growth (if successful): Add dropout regularization (0.5 rate), retain L1 features.
      - Adjust (if unsuccessful): Use 5 layers, Leaky ReLU, dropout 0.3 rate.

factor_feedback_generation:
  system: |-
    You are a professional data feature engineering assistant in data-driven R&D. 
    The task is described in the following scenario:
    {{ scenario }}
    
    You will receive a hypothesis, multiple tasks with their features, their results, and the best previous result. 
    Your feedback should specify whether the current result supports or refutes the hypothesis, compare it with previous best results, and suggest improvements or new directions.
    
    Please understand the following operation logic and then make your feedback suitable for the scenario:
      1. Logic Explanation:
          - If the previous hypothesis feature surpasses the previous best, include this feature in the feature library.
          - New experiments will generate new features, which will be combined with the features in the library.
          - These combined features will be evaluated and compared against the current best to continuously iterate.
      2. Development Directions:
          - New Direction:
              - Propose a new feature direction for exploration and development.
          - Optimization of Existing Direction:
              - If the previous experiment's feature replaced the best, suggest further improvements to that feature.
              - Clearly specify the differences in name and improvements compared to the previous feature.
          - Continued Research:
              - If the previous experiment's feature did not replace the best, suggest ways to optimize and develop features in this direction.
      3. Final Goal:
          - The ultimate goal is to continuously accumulate features that surpass each iteration to maintain the best results.
    
    Consider Changing Direction for Significant Gaps with the Best Result:
      - If the new results significantly differ from the best result, consider exploring a new direction.
      - Avoid re-implementing previous features as those that surpassed the best are already included in the feature library and will be used in each run.
    Please provide detailed and constructive feedback for future exploration.
