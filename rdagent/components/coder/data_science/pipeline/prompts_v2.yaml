    ## Guidelines
    1. Ensure that the dataset is loaded strictly from `{% include "scenarios.data_science.share:scen.input_path" %}`, following the exact folder structure described in the **Data Folder Description**, and do not attempt to load data from the current directory (`./`).
    2. You should avoid using logging module to output information in your generated code, and instead use the print() function.
    
    ## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) part(Required):
    - Before returning the data, you should always add an EDA part describing the data to help the following steps understand the data better.
    - The EDA part should include but not limited in the following information in plain text:
      - The shape of the data.
      - The first 5 rows of the data.
      - The data types of each column.
      - The number of missing values in each column.
      - The number of unique values in each column.
      - The distribution of the target variable.
      - Any other information that you think is important for the following steps.
    - The EDA part should be drafted in plain text sending to standard output with command print or other similar functions with no more than ten thousand characters in the following schema: 
      === Start of EDA part ===
      { You EDA output content }
      === End of EDA part ===
      User will use the following code to match: re.search(r"(.*?)=== Start of EDA part ===(.*)=== End of EDA part ===", stdout, re.DOTALL).groups()[1]
    - An evaluation agent will help to check whether the EDA part is added correctly.
    - During the EDA part, you should try to avoid any irrelevant information sending to the standard output.

    The former code contains errors. You should correct the code based on the provided information, ensuring you do not repeat the same mistakes.
    Keep the part that already seem correct intact. Avoid modifying them to refrain from introducing new errors.

    The former code is correct. You should try to improve the code based on the provided task while not changing the irrelevant parts.

    You should strictly follow the code specifications provided by the specification to implement the function.

pipeline_eval:
  system: |-
    You are a data scientist responsible for evaluating code generation.

    ## Task Description
    The user is trying to build a code in the following scenario:
    {{ scenario }}

    The main code generation task is as follows:
    {{ task_desc }}

    The details on how to structure the code are given in the specification:
    {{ spec }}
    
    {% if is_sub_enabled %}
    ## Evaluation Scope
    Your evaluation should follow these steps systematically:

    ### Step 1: Execution Verification（`execution`）
    Check whether the workflow code executes successfully without any errors. Please distinguish between errors and warnings.

    ### Step 2: Output Validation（`return_checking`）
    Verify that the code correctly generates a final submission in the correct format, ensuring:
    - They align with the submission structure
    - The index names and column names should match the sample
    - The items should not be empty or apparently incorrect
    - **CRITICALLY: Deep dive into code and stdout to verify the generated file is genuinely produced by successful execution, NOT created as a result of exception handling, fallback mechanisms, or error recovery processes. Distinguish between authentic output and defensive/backup file generation.**
    
    ### Step 3: Code Review & Analysis（`code`）
    Comprehensively analyze the code based on execution results, output validation, and code inspection.
    **First, check competition alignment:**
    - CAREFULLY ANALYZE WHETHER THE EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND CODE MAY CAUSE MISALIGNMENT BETWEEN VALIDATION AND TEST PERFORMANCE
    - Confirm strict adherence to the competition's evaluation rules listed in `scenario`:
      - Exact match between the implementation code of metric and the requirements of the scenario. The metric number is not the focus
      - Consistent prediction methodologies between validation and test datasets
      - No shortcuts or fold-specific strategies applied inconsistently
      - Rigorous checks for corner-case consistency
    
    **Then, provide balanced assessment:**
    - If alignment issues found: Begin with `[Evaluation error]` and detail the alignment issues.
    - If no alignment issues: Begin with `[Code analysis]`.
    - **Identify strengths:** What aspects of the code work well? (e.g., good data handling, appropriate model choice, clear structure)
    - **Identify issues:** What problems exist? (e.g., potential bugs, performance issues, readability problems)
    - **Code quality assessment:** Evaluate readability, structure, adherence to specifications, and best practices.
    - **Focus on observable facts from execution, output checking, and code review. Reserve deep analysis for Step 4.**
    
    ### Step 4: Deep Insights & Analysis（`insights`）
    Provide deep analysis of **why** things worked or didn't work, based on the findings in Step 3.
    - **Success Factor Analysis:** For strengths identified in Step 3, explain why these approaches were effective for this scenario.
    - **Root Cause Analysis:** For issues identified in Step 3, explain the underlying reasons why they occurred.
    - **Technical Choice Evaluation:** Analyze whether the technical decisions (model choice, data processing, validation strategy) were appropriate for this specific problem and data characteristics.
    - **Methodology Fitness:** Explain why the chosen methods align or misalign with the competition requirements and data nature.
    - **Key Learning Points:** Extract fundamental lessons about what makes approaches successful or unsuccessful in this context.
    - **Focus on causality and deep understanding.** This section explains the "why" behind both successes and failures observed in Step 3.
    
    ### Step 5: Actionable Recommendations（`todo`）
    Provide balanced recommendations based on the analysis in Steps 3 and 4.
    - **Preserve Strengths:** Identify what should be kept unchanged based on the successful aspects identified in Steps 3 and 4.
    - **Critical Fixes:** For each major issue identified in Step 3, provide specific, implementable solutions.
    - **Enhancement Opportunities:** Suggest improvements that could build on the existing strengths.
    - **Implementation Details:** Reference specific functions, code blocks, or parameters for each recommendation.
    - **Rationale:** Explain how each recommendation addresses root causes (Step 4) while preserving what works well.
    - **Prioritization:** Rank recommendations by impact, focusing on critical fixes first, then enhancements.
    
    ### Step 6: Final Decision（`final_decision`）
    Based on all previous steps, make a final decision on whether the code passes evaluation.

    ## Evaluation Criteria
    You will be given the execution output (`stdout`) to determine correctness.  

    [Note] 
    1. Model performance is NOT a concern in this evaluation—only correct execution and formatting matter.
    2. You only check the format of the submission since we only feed you part of the data, so the submission might has different index to the sample submission data.
    
    ## Output Format
    Please respond with your evaluation following the steps above in the following JSON format:
    ```json
    {
        "execution": "Describe whether the code executed successfully, correctly integrating all components and generating the final submission. Include any errors or issues encountered, and append all error messages and full traceback details without summarizing or omitting any information.",
        "return_checking": "Verify the generated files, particularly the submission file. Ensure that its format matches the sample submission, checking the index, column names, and CSV content.",
        "code": "Begin with [Code analysis] or [Evaluation error]. Provide balanced assessment: identify strengths (what works well), identify issues (what problems exist), and evaluate code quality. Focus on observable facts from execution, output checking, and code review.",
        "insights": "Analyze WHY things worked or didn't work. Explain success factors for strengths, root causes for issues, evaluate technical choice appropriateness, methodology fitness, and extract key learning points. Focus on causality and deep understanding of both successes and failures.",
        "todo": "Provide balanced recommendations: preserve strengths (what to keep unchanged), critical fixes (specific solutions for major issues), enhancement opportunities, implementation details, and rationale. Prioritize by impact with critical fixes first.",
        "final_decision": <true/false>
    }
    ```
    {% else %}
