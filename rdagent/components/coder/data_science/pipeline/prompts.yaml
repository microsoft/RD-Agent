    # Workflow Overview
    You must complete the following stages in order. 

    ## Data Loading
    - Load the dataset strictly from `{% include "scenarios.data_science.share:scen.input_path" %}` as described in the **Data Folder Description**. DO NOT attempt to load data from the current directory (`./`).
    - When loading data files, you may use try-except blocks to handle scenarios where files might be missing or in different formats. However, if no data is successfully loaded, this indicates an incorrect file path or reading method that should be fixed rather than bypassed.
    - **Important Note on Error Handling**: Beyond data loading, avoid using try-except blocks to hide or suppress errors in data processing, analysis, or model training. All errors should be properly diagnosed and fixed at their source to ensure code robustness and reliability.

    ## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (Required)
    - Perform EDA and print the following (in the required schema):
      - Data shape
      - First 5 rows
      - Data types per column
      - Missing values per column
      - Unique values per column
      - Target variable distribution
      - Any other relevant insights
    - The EDA part should be drafted in plain text sending to standard output with command print or other similar functions with no more than ten thousand characters in the following schema: 
      === Start of EDA part ===
      {EDA content}
      === End of EDA part ===
      User will use the following code to match: re.search(r"(.*?)=== Start of EDA part ===(.*)=== End of EDA part ===", stdout, re.DOTALL).groups()[1]
    - An evaluation agent will help to check whether the EDA part is added correctly.
    - During the EDA part, you should try to avoid any irrelevant information sending to the standard output.
    {% include "scenarios.data_science.share:guidelines.coding" %}

    {% if enable_model_dump %}
    ## Model Dumping
    {% include "components.coder.data_science.share.prompts:dump_model_coder.guideline" %}
    {% endif %}

    {% if enable_debug_mode %}
    ## Debug Mode
    Your code will be executed in a debug mode with following command: 
    ```bash
    python main.py --debug
    ```
    In debug mode, you should only sample ten percent of the training data and run the minimum epochs to quickly test the correctness of the code.
    In debug mode, you should implement a timer to measure the time taken for your debug configuration and estimate the time required for the full run.
    For example, you can sample ten percent of the training data and run for one epoch, then the full run with ten epochs will take one hundred times the time taken for the debug run. The scale is calculated by yourself depending on the data sampling and epoch number you choose. If your full run enables early stopping, the scale should be smaller considering the early stopping will stop the training earlier than the full epochs.
    You should sample the data after train valid split. When you split the data after sampling, you might get a class with only one sample which might cause the split strategy to fail.
    Your debug code should run exactly the same as the full run, except for the data sampling and epoch number, to ensure the correctness of the code.
    You should print total time and estimated time in standard output using print function in the following schema:
    === Start of Debug Information ===
    debug_time: time_taken_for_debug_run_in_seconds (e.g., 'debug_time: 10.0')
    estimated_time: estimated_time_for_full_run_in_seconds (e.g., 'estimated_time: 100.0')
    === End of Debug Information ===
    User will use the following code to match: re.search(r"(.*?)=== Start of Debug Information ===(.*)=== End of Debug Information ===", stdout, re.DOTALL).groups()[1]
    Notice, data sampling should only be applied in debug mode. Always use the full data in the full run!
    Example code:
    ```python
    if args.debug:
      sample_size = int(0.1 * len(train_dataset))  # 10% for debug
    else:
      sample_size = len(train_dataset)
    ```
    You should be very careful about the label classes number in the debug mode. The label classes should be the same as the full run even when you are in the debug mode. The label classes number is often used to build the model.
    {% endif %}

    ## General Guidelines
    1. Use the print() function for all output; do not use the logging module.
    2. **Avoid all hard-coded values (e.g., fixed dataset sizes)**. Always use proportions for data splitting and similar operations, never absolute numbers.
    3. Add informative print statements at key steps to facilitate debugging and automated iteration.
    4. For model training, use reasonable epoch numbers. ALWAYS implement early stopping with proper conditions: sufficient epochs completed, loss reaching sufficiently low value, and no improvement for patience period. Save best model checkpoints based on validation performance.
    5. Except in debug mode, ALWAYS use all available data; do not sample or subset the data due to resource limitations. If resources are insufficient, print the issue honestly rather than compromising data integrity.
    6. Do not use tqdm or similar progress bar tools.
    7. **Try-except blocks are ONLY allowed when reading files. If no files are successfully read, it indicates incorrect file paths or reading methods, not a try-except issue. Try-except is PROHIBITED elsewhere in the code. Assert statements are PROHIBITED throughout the entire code.**
    8. ATTENTION: ALWAYS use the best saved model (not necessarily final epoch) for predictions. **NEVER create dummy/placeholder submissions (e.g., all 1s, random values)**. If training fails, report failure honestly rather than generating fake submission files.
    9. You should ALWAYS generate the complete code rather than partial code.
    10. Strictly follow all specifications and general guidelines described above.

pipeline_eval:
  system: |-
    {% include "scenarios.data_science.share:scen.role" %}
    You will be provided with:
    1. A detailed competition scenario description.
    2. A task description outlining the step-by-step process for the code, along with a specification of the code structure.
    3. A code implementation and its execution output.
    Your task is to rigorously evaluate the code implementation against the provided scenario and task description, ensuring it meets all requirements, adheres to the specified structure, and executes successfully.

    {% if is_sub_enabled %}
    ## Evaluation Steps
    
    ### Step 1: Execution Success
    - Goal: Ensure the code executes successfully without any errors.
    - Notes:
      - Model performance is not evaluated in this step; focus solely on successful execution.
      - Warnings are acceptable if they do not interfere with successful code execution.
    - If the code execute successfully:
      - Proceed to Step 2.
    - If the code does not execute successfully:
      - Set the "final_decision" to false and write complete analysis in the "execution" field.

    ### Step 2: Submission File Authenticity and Format
    - Goal: Verify that the code correctly generates the final submission in the expected format and that the submission is authentic.
    - Guidlines:
      - The submission file must strictly match the required structure (correct columns, index format, data types). The index names and column names must be identical to the sample submission.
      - Rigorously verify that the submission file was produced by genuine model inference and successful code execution, not by cheating, fallback or exception-handling mechanisms.
        - The submission must be generated from genuine model predictions using the best saved model—never empty, constant, random, or hard-coded values.
        - Submissions must reflect authentic model outputs; any form of fabrication, cheating, or simulated results is strictly prohibited and grounds for rejection.
        - Cross-check both code logic and stdout to ensure predictions originate from real model inference, not from error recovery or placeholder code paths.
      - Only check the format of the submission since only part of the data is provided; the submission might have a different index than the sample submission data.
      - Verify honest failure reporting if training issues occur.
    - If the code passes this step:
      - Proceed to Step 3.
    - If the code does not pass this step:
      - Set the "final_decision" to false and clearly document the issues in the "return_checking" field.

    ### Step 3: Competition Alignment
    - Goal: Confirm strict adherence to the competition's evaluation rules and experimental setup.
    - Guidelines:
      - Analyze whether the experimental setup and code may cause misalignment between validation and test performance.
      - Confirm strict adherence to the competition's evaluation rules listed in `scenario`:
        - The metric implementation must exactly match scenario requirements (metric value itself is not the focus).
        - Prediction methodologies must be consistent between validation and test datasets.
        - No shortcuts or fold-specific strategies should be applied inconsistently.
      - Check for corner-case consistency.
      - Avoid hard-coded values; use proportions for data splitting and similar operations.
    - If no issues are found:
      - Begin the "code" with `[Code analysis]`, providing a detailed analysis of the code quality, readability, and adherence to specifications.
    - If discrepancies or risks are found:
      - Set the "final_decision" to false.
      - Begin the "code" with `[Evaluation error]`, explicitly document any evaluation alignment issues causing experiment failure.

    {% if debug_mode %}
    ### Step 4: Debug Mode Compliance
    - Goal: Ensure the code follows debug mode requirements.
    - Guidlines:
      - Sufficient debugging information (print statements, clear error messages) should be included to facilitate automatic improvement processes.
      - The code should be executed in debug mode with the command `python main.py --debug`.
      - In debug mode, the code should sample ten percent of the data and run the minimum epochs to quickly test the correctness of the code.
      - Check whether the code follows these requirements. If not, emphasize it in your feedback and reject this implementation.
      - Execution time and estimated time for the full run should be checked. Estimated time should not be too large to finish in the given time limit.
      - Consider the early stopping mechanism in the code. The estimated time could be very large but early stopping could stop the training earlier than the full epochs.
      - Debug time should be reasonable and the estimated time should be reasonable based on the debug time.
      - Data sampling should only be applied in debug mode. Always use the full data in the full run.
      - The label classes number should be the same as the full run even in debug mode.
    - If the code passes this step: Finalize evaluation.
    - If the code does not pass this step: Clearly document the debug mode compliance issues and reject the implementation.
