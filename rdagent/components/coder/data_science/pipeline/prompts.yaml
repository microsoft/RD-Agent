    ## Guidelines
    1. Ensure that the dataset is loaded strictly from `{% include "scenarios.data_science.share:scen.input_path" %}`, following the exact folder structure described in the **Data Folder Description**, and do not attempt to load data from the current directory (`./`).
    2. You should avoid using logging module to output information in your generated code, and instead use the print() function.
    3. You should be very careful about the try catch block in your code. You may use it to handle missing files in data reading, but you should not use it to handle the errors in your code. Especially use it to bypass the errors in your code. Directly solve the errors in your code instead of using try catch block to bypass them.
    
    ## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) part(Required):
    - Before returning the data, you should always add an EDA part describing the data to help the following steps understand the data better.
    - The EDA part should include but not limited in the following information in plain text:
      - The shape of the data.
      - The first 5 rows of the data.
      - The data types of each column.
      - The number of missing values in each column.
      - The number of unique values in each column.
      - The distribution of the target variable.
      - Any other information that you think is important for the following steps.
    - The EDA part should be drafted in plain text sending to standard output with command print or other similar functions with no more than ten thousand characters in the following schema: 
      === Start of EDA part ===
      { You EDA output content }
      === End of EDA part ===
      User will use the following code to match: re.search(r"(.*?)=== Start of EDA part ===(.*)=== End of EDA part ===", stdout, re.DOTALL).groups()[1]
    - An evaluation agent will help to check whether the EDA part is added correctly.
    - During the EDA part, you should try to avoid any irrelevant information sending to the standard output.
    {% include "scenarios.data_science.share:guidelines.coding" %}

    {% if enable_model_dump %}
    ## Model Dumping
    {% include "components.coder.data_science.share.prompts:dump_model_coder.guideline" %}
    {% endif %}

    {% if enable_debug_mode %}
    Your code will be executed in a debug mode with following command: 
    ```bash
    python main.py --debug
    ```
    In debug mode, you should only sample ten percent of the data and run the minimum epochs to quickly test the correctness of the code.
    In debug mode, you should implement a timer to measure the time taken for your debug configuration and estimate the time required for the full run.
    For example, you can sample ten percent of the data and run for one epoch, then the full run with ten epochs will take one hundred times the time taken for the debug run. The scale is calculated by yourself depending on the data sampling and epoch number you choose. If your full run enables early stopping, the scale should be smaller considering the early stopping will stop the training earlier than the full epochs.
    Your debug code should run exactly the same as the full run, except for the data sampling and epoch number, to ensure the correctness of the code.
    You should print total time and estimated time in standard output using print function in the following schema:
    === Start of Debug Information ===
    debug_time: time_taken_for_debug_run_in_seconds (e.g., 'debug_time: 10.0')
    estimated_time: estimated_time_for_full_run_in_seconds (e.g., 'estimated_time: 100.0')
    === End of Debug Information ===
    User will use the following code to match: re.search(r"(.*?)=== Start of Debug Information ===(.*)=== End of Debug Information ===", stdout, re.DOTALL).groups()[1]
    Notice, data sampling should only be applied in debug mode. Always use the full data in the full run!
    Example code:
    ```python
    if args.debug:
      sample_size = int(0.1 * len(train_dataset))  # 10% for debug
    else:
      sample_size = len(train_dataset)
    ```
    {% endif %}

    ## Output Format
    {% if out_spec %}
    {{ out_spec }}
    {% else %}
    Please response the code in the following json format. Here is an example structure for the JSON output:
    {
        "code": "The Python code as a string."
    }
    {% endif %}

pipeline_eval:
  system: |-
    You are a data scientist responsible for evaluating code generation.

    ## Task Description
    The user is trying to build a code in the following scenario:
    {{ scenario }}

    The main code generation task is as follows:
    {{ task_desc }}

    The details on how to structure the code are given in the specification:
    {{ spec }}
    
    {% if is_sub_enabled %}
    ## Evaluation Scope
    Your focus is to check whether the workflow code:
    Step 1: Executes successfully without any errors. Please distinguish between the errors and warnings.

    Step 2: Correctly generates a final submission in the correct format, ensuring: they align with the submission structure, the index names and column names should match the sample, and the items should not be empty or apparently incorrect. The final submission and validation metrics should not be generated with mock data or dummy values. They should only the results of the actual code execution. Once you found the coding containing any data mock or dummy values, you should emphasize it in your feedback and reject this implementation.

    Step 3: No data sampling is applied in the full run, and the code runs on the full dataset. The code should not contain any data sampling or data reduction logic in the full run. Once you found any data sampling or reduction logic in the full run, you should emphasize it in your feedback and reject this implementation.

    Step 4: Aligns with the competition requirements. This includes:
    - CAREFULLY ANALYZE WHETHER THE EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND CODE MAY CAUSE MISALIGNMENT BETWEEN VALIDATION AND TEST PERFORMANCE.
    - Confirm strict adherence to the competition's evaluation rules listed in `scenario`:
      - Exact match between the implementation code of metric and the requirements of the scenario. The metric number is not the focus.
      - Consistent prediction methodologies between validation and test datasets.
      - No shortcuts or fold-specific strategies applied inconsistently.
      - Rigorous checks for corner-case consistency.
    - If such discrepancies or risks are found:
      - Clearly document these issues in `code`.
      - Begin your `code` with `[Evaluation error]`, explicitly stating the evaluation alignment issues causing experiment failure.
    - If no issues are found, begin your `code` with `[Code analysis]`, providing a detailed analysis of the code quality, readability, and adherence to specifications.

    {% if debug_mode %}
    Step 5: The code is executed in a debug mode with the command `python main.py --debug`. In debug mode, the code should sample ten percent of the data and run the minimum epochs to quickly test the correctness of the code. You should check whether the code follows this requirements. If not, you should emphasize it in your feedback and reject this implementation.
    You will also be given the execution time and estimated time for the full run. If not time information is provided or the estimated full run time is more than three times the timeout period, you should reject the implementation because the full run will not finish in time. 
    {% endif %}

    ## Evaluation Criteria
    You will be given the execution output (`stdout`) to determine correctness.  

    [Note] 
    1. Model performance is NOT a concern in this evaluation—only correct execution and formatting matter.
    2. You only check the format of the submission since we only feed you part of the data, so the submission might has different index to the sample submission data.
    
    Please respond with your feedback in the following JSON format and order
    ```json
    {
        "execution": "Describe whether the code executed successfully, correctly integrating all components and generating the final submission. Include any errors or issues encountered, and append all error messages and full traceback details without summarizing or omitting any information.",
        "return_checking": "Verify the generated files, particularly the submission file. Ensure that its format matches the sample submission, checking the index, column names, and CSV content.",
        "code": "Begin explicitly with [Code analysis] or [Evaluation error]. Provide feedback on code quality, readability, adherence to the given specifications, and alignment with competition requirements.",
        "final_decision": <true/false>
    }
    ```
