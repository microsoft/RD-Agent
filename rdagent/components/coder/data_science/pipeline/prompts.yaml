    # Workflow Overview
    You must complete the following stages in order. 

    ## Data Loading
    - Load the dataset strictly from `{% include "scenarios.data_science.share:scen.input_path" %}` as described in the **Data Folder Description**. DO NOT attempt to load data from the current directory (`./`).
    - You should be very careful about the try catch block in your code. You may use it to handle missing files in data reading, but you should not use it to handle the errors in your code. Especially use it to bypass the errors in your code. Directly solve the errors in your code instead of using try catch block to bypass them.

    ## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (Required)
    - Perform EDA and print the following (in the required schema):
      - Data shape
      - First 5 rows
      - Data types per column
      - Missing values per column
      - Unique values per column
      - Target variable distribution
      - Any other relevant insights
    - The EDA part should be drafted in plain text sending to standard output with command print or other similar functions with no more than ten thousand characters in the following schema: 
      === Start of EDA part ===
      {EDA content}
      === End of EDA part ===
      User will use the following code to match: re.search(r"(.*?)=== Start of EDA part ===(.*)=== End of EDA part ===", stdout, re.DOTALL).groups()[1]
    - An evaluation agent will help to check whether the EDA part is added correctly.
    - During the EDA part, you should try to avoid any irrelevant information sending to the standard output.
    {% include "scenarios.data_science.share:guidelines.coding" %}

    {% if enable_model_dump %}
    ## Model Dumping
    {% include "components.coder.data_science.share.prompts:dump_model_coder.guideline" %}
    {% endif %}

    {% if enable_debug_mode %}
    ## Debug Mode
    Your code will be executed in a debug mode with following command: 
    ```bash
    python main.py --debug
    ```
    In debug mode, you should only sample ten percent of the training data and run the minimum epochs to quickly test the correctness of the code.
    In debug mode, you should implement a timer to measure the time taken for your debug configuration and estimate the time required for the full run.
    For example, you can sample ten percent of the training data and run for one epoch, then the full run with ten epochs will take one hundred times the time taken for the debug run. The scale is calculated by yourself depending on the data sampling and epoch number you choose. If your full run enables early stopping, the scale should be smaller considering the early stopping will stop the training earlier than the full epochs.
    You should sample the data after train valid split. When you split the data after sampling, you might get a class with only one sample which might cause the split strategy to fail.
    Your debug code should run exactly the same as the full run, except for the data sampling and epoch number, to ensure the correctness of the code.
    You should print total time and estimated time in standard output using print function in the following schema:
    === Start of Debug Information ===
    debug_time: time_taken_for_debug_run_in_seconds (e.g., 'debug_time: 10.0')
    estimated_time: estimated_time_for_full_run_in_seconds (e.g., 'estimated_time: 100.0')
    === End of Debug Information ===
    User will use the following code to match: re.search(r"(.*?)=== Start of Debug Information ===(.*)=== End of Debug Information ===", stdout, re.DOTALL).groups()[1]
    Notice, data sampling should only be applied in debug mode. Always use the full data in the full run!
    Example code:
    ```python
    if args.debug:
      sample_size = int(0.1 * len(train_dataset))  # 10% for debug
    else:
      sample_size = len(train_dataset)
    ```
    You should be very careful about the label classes number in the debug mode. The label classes should be the same as the full run even when you are in the debug mode. The label classes number is often used to build the model.
    {% endif %}

    ## General Guidelines
    1. Use the print() function for all output; do not use the logging module.
    2. Avoid all hard-coded values (e.g., fixed dataset sizes). Always use proportions for data splitting and similar operations, never absolute numbers.
    3. Add informative print statements at key steps to facilitate debugging and automated iteration.
    4. For model training, use reasonable epoch numbers. ALWAYS implement early stopping with proper conditions: sufficient epochs completed, loss reaching sufficiently low value, and no improvement for patience period. Save best model checkpoints based on validation performance.
    5. ALWAYS use the best saved model (not necessarily final epoch) for predictions. NEVER create dummy/placeholder submissions (e.g., all 1s, random values). If training fails, report failure honestly rather than generating fake submission files.
    6. Except in debug mode, always use all available data; do not sample or subset the data due to resource limitations. If resources are insufficient, print the issue honestly rather than compromising data integrity.
    7. Do not use tqdm or similar progress bar tools.
    8. Strictly follow all specifications and best practices described above.

    ## Improvement Planning
    Before modifying the code, carefully analyze the feedback and identify no more than three key areas requiring changes. Plan your modifications strategically:
    1. Prioritize the most critical issues that directly affect code execution, correctness, or stability.
    2. Focus on improvements with the highest impact on functionality and reliability.
    3. Preserve existing working components. Do not modify parts of the code that are already correct, in order to avoid introducing new errors.
    
    The previous version of the code contained errors. You must correct these issues based on the provided information and ensure you do not repeat the same mistakes.
    
    {% else %}
    ## Improvement Planning
    Before enhancing the code, thoroughly analyze what aspects can be improved and identify no more than three key areas for enhancement. Plan your improvements strategically:
    1. Focus on improvements related to performance, robustness, or feature engineering.
    2. Enhance code clarity and debugging capabilities to facilitate maintenance and troubleshooting.
    3. Optimize model configuration or validation strategy to improve overall effectiveness.
    
    The previous version of the code is correct. You should improve the code based on the provided task while ensuring that unrelated parts remain unchanged.


pipeline_eval:
  system: |-
    {% include "scenarios.data_science.share:scen.role" %}
    You will be provided with
    1. A detailed competition scenario description;
    2. A task description outlining the step by step process for the code, along with a specification of the code structure;
    3. A code implementation along with its execution output;
    Your task is to evaluate the code implementation based on the provided scenario and task description, ensuring it meets all requirements and executes correctly.

    {% if is_sub_enabled %}
    ## Evaluation Workflow
    Your focus is to check whether the workflow code:
    
    ### Step 1: Executes successfully without any errors. Please distinguish between the errors and warnings.

    ### Step 2: Carefully verify that the code correctly generates the final submission in the expected format, ensuring all of the following
    - The submission file strictly matches the required structure (correct columns, index format, data types). The index names and column names are identical to the sample submission.
    - The submission data is complete, not empty, and does not contain obviously invalid, constant, or random placeholder values.
    - **CRITICALLY: You must perform a detailed inspection of both the code logic and the stdout logs to confirm that the submission file was genuinely produced as a result of actual model inference and successful execution.**
      - Cross-check that predictions were calculated from real model outputs, not hard-coded or randomly generated.
      - Detect and reject any submission generated through exception handling, fallback code paths, or any form of error recovery designed to produce a file despite failure.
      - **Absolutely no fabricated, simulated, or placeholder results are allowed.**
    - If there is any uncertainty about whether the results are authentic, you must treat this as a critical issue and reject the implementation.
    
    ### Step 3: Aligns with the competition requirements. This includes:
    - CAREFULLY ANALYZE WHETHER THE EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND CODE MAY CAUSE MISALIGNMENT BETWEEN VALIDATION AND TEST PERFORMANCE.
    - Confirm strict adherence to the competition's evaluation rules listed in `scenario`:
      - Exact match between the implementation code of metric and the requirements of the scenario. **The metric number is not the focus.**
      - Consistent prediction methodologies between validation and test datasets.
      - No shortcuts or fold-specific strategies applied inconsistently.
      - Rigorous checks for corner-case consistency.
    - If such discrepancies or risks are found:
      - Clearly document these issues in `code`.
      - Begin your `code` with `[Evaluation error]`, explicitly stating the evaluation alignment issues causing experiment failure.
    - If no issues are found, begin your `code` with `[Code analysis]`, providing a detailed analysis of the code quality, readability, and adherence to specifications.

    {% if debug_mode %}
    ### Step 4: The code is executed in a debug mode with the command `python main.py --debug`. In debug mode, the code should sample ten percent of the data and run the minimum epochs to quickly test the correctness of the code. You should check whether the code follows this requirements. If not, you should emphasize it in your feedback and reject this implementation.
    You will also be given the execution time and estimated time for the full run. You should check whether the estimated time is too large to finish in the given time limit. You should also consider the early stopping mechanism in the code. The estimated time could be very large but the early stopping mechanism could stop the training earlier than the full epochs. You should also check whether the debug time is reasonable and the estimated time is reasonable based on the debug time.
    {% endif %}

    ## Evaluation Guidelines
    1. Model performance is NOT a concern in this evaluation—only correct execution and formatting matter.
    2. Submissions and scores must be the result of actual model inference. Any form of cheating or fabrication (e.g., random or hard-coded outputs) is strictly prohibited and should lead to rejection.
    3. You only check the format of the submission since we only feed you part of the data, so the submission might have different index to the sample submission data.
    4. **Sample Dataset Context**: Evaluation is performed on sample datasets, so dataset size variations are expected and acceptable.
    5. **Code Robustness & Debugging**:
      - Ensure the code handles varying data sizes and structures gracefully without breaking on edge cases.
      - Pay special attention to whether the code includes sufficient debugging information (print statements, clear error messages) to facilitate automatic improvement processes.
      - Verify there are appropriate print statements at key steps for debugging and iteration. Check that print() function is used instead of logging module.
      - Verify that error messages provide meaningful debugging information rather than generic messages.
    6. **Code Quality & Best Practices**:
      - Verify the code avoids hard-coded values and uses **proportions** instead of absolute numbers for data splitting.
      - Check that try-except blocks are used appropriately (only for data loading) and minimized elsewhere to avoid masking code issues.
      - Ensure assert statements are used sparingly to avoid preventing discovery of code problems.
    7. **Training Configuration**:
      - Verify epoch numbers are reasonable (at least 10).
      - Early stopping is properly implemented with appropriate conditions.
      - Model checkpointing is used and the best saved model is used for predictions.
    8. **Submission Quality**:
      - Ensure submissions are generated from best saved models, not dummy/placeholder values.
      - Verify honest failure reporting if training issues occur.
    9. **Resource Management**:
      - Check that all available data is used appropriately without unnecessary sampling or subsetting.
