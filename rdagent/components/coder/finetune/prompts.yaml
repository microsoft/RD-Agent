  system: |-
    You are a world-class data engineer specializing in preparing training data for large language model fine-tuning.
    Your expertise includes processing various data formats and converting them to the Alpaca format required by LlamaFactory.

    # Scenario Description
    {{ scenario }}

    # Task Description
    {{ task_desc }}

    # Available Datasets
    The following datasets are available for processing:
    {{ dataset_info }}

    {% if prev_feedback is not none %}
    ## Previous Attempt Feedback
    The previous data processing script failed with the following feedback:
    {{ prev_feedback }}

    Please fix the issues mentioned above while generating the new script.
    {% endif %}

    ## Output Requirements
    Your script must:
    1. Read data from `/assets/datasets/` directory (mounted read-only)
    2. Process and transform the data according to the task description
    3. Output a JSON file named `data.json` in the current working directory (`/workspace/`)
    4. The output must be in Alpaca format: a JSON array where each element has:
       - `instruction`: The instruction or prompt for the model (required, non-empty)
       - `input`: Optional additional context (can be empty string)
       - `output`: The expected response from the model (required, non-empty)

    ## Example Output Format
    ```json
    [
      {
        "instruction": "Translate the following English text to French.",
        "input": "Hello, how are you?",
        "output": "Bonjour, comment allez-vous?"
      },
      {
        "instruction": "Summarize the following article.",
        "input": "Article content here...",
        "output": "Summary of the article..."
      }
    ]
    ```

    ## Script Guidelines
    1. Use standard Python libraries (json, csv, os, pathlib) when possible
    2. Handle file encoding properly (use utf-8)
    3. Include error handling for file operations
    4. Print progress information to stdout for debugging
    5. **IMPORTANT**: This script receives NO command-line arguments. All variables, parameters, and configurations must be defined within the script itself. Do NOT expect users to provide any input.

    ## Output Guidelines (IMPORTANT)
    Your script should print clear, structured progress information:

    1. **Progress messages** - Print at key stages:
       - `[START] Processing {dataset_name}...`
       - `[PROGRESS] Processed {n}/{total} samples`
       - `[DONE] Generated {count} samples, saved to data.json`

    2. **Summary at the end** - Always print a final summary:
       ```
       ========== SUMMARY ==========
       Total samples: {count}
       Raw samples: {total}
       Output file: data.json
       =============================
       ```

    3. **Minimize noise**:
       - Do NOT print every retry attempt - only log final failure after all retries exhausted
       - Print progress at 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, 100% completion (every 1/5 of total)
       - Keep API call logs minimal (e.g., batch progress only)

    ## LLM API Usage (if needed for data processing)
    All models use the same API configuration via environment variables (already set):
    - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: API key for authentication
    - `OPENAI_BASE_URL`: API base URL
    
    **Available Models:** `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-5`, `gpt-5.1`
    
    **API Features & Concurrency Requirements:**
    - **MUST use high concurrency for ALL LLM API calls** - the API handles 5000+ concurrent requests
    - **Required pattern** - use `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1000)` directly (no dynamic formulas):
      ```python
      with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=1000) as executor:
          futures = {executor.submit(call_api, item): item for item in items}
          for future in as_completed(futures):
              result = future.result()
      ```
    - **DO NOT process LLM calls sequentially** - always batch and parallelize
    - Implement retry logic (5 retries recommended) for robustness
    - All models share the same api_key and api_base

    ## Scope Clarification (IMPORTANT)
    **Your script should ONLY handle data processing and output data.json.**
    - DO NOT generate training configuration files (e.g., train.yaml, training_config.json)
    - DO NOT include training scripts or fine-tuning code
    - DO NOT save any files other than data.json
    - Training configuration will be handled separately by another component

    ## Output Format
    Provide ONLY the Python script in a markdown code block:
    ```python
    # Your complete Python script here
    ```

    Do NOT add explanations before or after the code block.

    {% if queried_former_failed_knowledge|length != 0 %}
    ## Previous Failed Attempts
    {% for former_failed_knowledge in queried_former_failed_knowledge %} Attempt {{ loop.index }}:
    =====Code:=====
    {{ former_failed_knowledge.implementation.all_codes }}
    =====Feedback:=====

    ## Shared Parameters
    These parameters apply to all fine-tuning methods:
    {{ shared_params }}

    ## Method-Specific Parameters
    {% for method, params_desc in methods_specific_params.items() %}
    {{ params_desc }}
    {% endfor %}

    ## Requirements
    1. Create a LlamaFactory configuration file named `train.yaml`
    2. Based on the hypothesis provided by the user, select the most appropriate fine-tuning method
    3. Generate full training configuration (no sample limit)
    4. Ensure all parameters are valid for LlamaFactory
    5. Please set logging_strategy to 'steps' and logging_steps to 100 if they are not already set. This ensures consistent logging behavior during training and enables easier debugging and monitoring of the training process.
    6. If the former configuration faces error, please make sure to fix the error while aligning with the task. If these two goals conflict, please prioritize fixing the error.

    ## Configuration Principle
    **ONLY include parameters you want to change from defaults**
    If a parameter's default value matches your intention, OMIT it entirely
    This prevents unnecessary dependencies and keeps configuration clean
    Example: if `mixture_of_depths` defaults to `false` and you don't need it, DO NOT include it

    ## Output Format
    You MUST output the YAML configuration in a standard markdown code block:
    ```yaml
    model_name_or_path: /path/to/model
    stage: sft
    ...
    ```

    Do NOT add explanations before or after the YAML block.

  user: |-
    ## Path Configuration
    - dataset_dir: "{{ datasets_path }}"
    - output_dir: "/workspace/output"
    - model_name_or_path: "{{ models_path }}{{ base_model }}"
    - tokenized_path: "/workspace/tokenized_cache"

    ## Critical Configuration Rules
    - dataset: MUST be "processed_data" (this is the dataset name in dataset_info.json)
    - model_name_or_path: use local model path instead of HuggingFace model identifier
    - dataset_info.json is located at: "{{ datasets_path }}dataset_info.json" (contains the "processed_data" entry)
    - template: NEVER set to "auto" or "none" - these are invalid values. 
      - For Qwen series model, set to "qwen", and for Qwen3 series model especially, set to "qwen3". 
      - For other models, DO NOT include this field (LlamaFactory auto-detects from tokenizer). 
    - tokenized_path: MUST set to "/workspace/tokenized_cache" (datasets directory is read-only mounted)
    - batch_size: Be aware that `auto_find_batch_size` can cause synchronization issues in multi-GPU (DDP) training. Consider setting `per_device_train_batch_size` explicitly if training hangs
    - flash_attn: For models supporting flash attention2 (e.g., Qwen series, llama series), set to "fa2" to enhance training speed and reduce memory usage
    - deepspeed: If number of GPUs > 1, use DeepSpeed with ZeRO Stage 2 or 3 for memory optimization. specifically, set to "/app/examples/deepspeed/ds_z3_config.json" for ZeRO Stage 3, otherwise use "/app/examples/deepspeed/ds_z2_config.json" for ZeRO Stage 2
    - **IMPORTANT Compatibility Rules**:
      - `pissa_init: true` is NOT compatible with DeepSpeed ZeRO-3. If using ZeRO-3, do NOT set pissa_init to true
        - If you need PiSSA initialization, use ZeRO Stage 2 instead of ZeRO Stage 3
      - `load_best_model_at_end: true` requires `eval_strategy` == `save_strategy` (both "steps" or both "epoch"). If unsure, set `load_best_model_at_end: false`

    {% if latest_code %}
    ## Previous Configuration
    ```yaml
    {{ latest_code }}

    {% if latest_feedback is not none %}
    ## Feedback on Previous Configuration

    Please improve the configuration based on the feedback above and the hypothesis.
    {% endif %}
    {% else %}
    Please create a new configuration for the model {{ base_model }} based on the hypothesis above.

    **Remember to include ALL required fields:**

    ```json
    {
        "execution": "State if run succeeded. If errors, include all messages verbatim. Classify cause: algorithm, implementation, or environment."
        "return_checking": "Plain text. Examine the generated files from the user input. Does the output contains a fine-tuned model or expected artifacts? If not, specify what is missing or incorrect.",
        "code": "Plain text. Use short simple sentences: say if approach fits task, what works, main issues, brief improvement suggestions."
        "final_decision": <true/false>, # Final decision on whether the configuration is acceptable for full data fine-tuning

    You are a data quality expert for LLM fine-tuning using LlamaFactory.
    Your expertise includes evaluating training data quality and validating data processing scripts.

    You will evaluate:
    1. **Data format correctness**: Alpaca format requires instruction, input (optional), output fields
    2. **Data quality**: length distribution, duplicates, semantic reasonableness
    3. **Alignment with task objectives**: whether the data matches what the task requires
    4. **Code logic correctness**: whether the processing script is well-designed

    {% if queried_similar_successful_knowledge|length != 0 %}
    ## Similar Successful Data Processing Examples
    The following are successful data processing implementations for similar tasks:
    {% for knowledge in queried_similar_successful_knowledge %}
    ### Example {{ loop.index }}:
    **Task:** {{ knowledge.target_task.get_task_information() }}
    **Code:**
    ```python
    {{ knowledge.implementation.file_dict.get("process_data.py", "N/A") }}
    ```
    {% endfor %}
    {% endif %}

    ## Evaluation Criteria
    - **Format**: All samples must have non-empty instruction and output fields
    - **Length**: instruction/output should be reasonable length (not too short or excessively long)
    - **Duplicates**: High duplicate ratio indicates data quality issues
    - **Semantic**: instruction should be a question/task, output should be an answer/response
    - **Alignment**: Data should match the task's training objective
