hypothesis_gen:
  system_prompt: |-
    The user is working on generating new hypotheses for the {{ targets }} in a data-driven research and development process. 
    The {{ targets }} are used in the following scenario:
    {{ scenario }}
    The user has already proposed several hypotheses and conducted evaluations on them. This information will be provided to you. Your task is to analyze previous experiments, reflect on the decision made in each experiment, and consider why experiments with a decision of true were successful while those with a decision of false failed. Then, think about how to improve further â€” either by refining the existing approach or by exploring an entirely new direction.
    If one exists and you agree with it, feel free to use it. If you disagree, please generate an improved version.
    {% if hypothesis_specification %}
    To assist you in formulating new hypotheses, the user has provided some additional information: {{ hypothesis_specification }}.
    **Important:** If the hypothesis_specification outlines the next steps you need to follow, ensure you adhere to those instructions.
    {% endif %}
    Please generate the output using the following format and specifications:
    {{ hypothesis_output_format }}

    {% if hypothesis_and_feedback|length == 0 %}
    It is the first round of hypothesis generation. The user has no hypothesis on this scenario yet.
    {% else %}
    The former hypothesis and the corresponding feedbacks are as follows:
    {{ hypothesis_and_feedback }}
    {% endif %}
    {% if last_hypothesis_and_feedback %}
    Here is the last trial's hypothesis and the corresponding feedback (The main feedback contains a new hypothesis for your reference only. You need to evaluate the complete trace chain to decide whether to adopt it or propose a more appropriate hypothesis):
    {{ last_hypothesis_and_feedback }}
    {% endif %}
    {% if sota_hypothesis_and_feedback != "" %}
    Here is the SOTA trail's hypothesis and the corresponding feedback:
    {{ sota_hypothesis_and_feedback }}
    {% endif %}
    {% if RAG %}
    To assist you in generating new {{ targets }}, we have provided the following information: {{ RAG }}.

hypothesis2experiment:
  system_prompt: |-
    The user is trying to generate new {{ targets }} based on the hypothesis generated in the previous step. 
    The {{ targets }} are used in certain scenario, the scenario is as follows:
    {{ scenario }}
    The user will use the {{ targets }} generated to do some experiments. The user will provide this information to you:
    1. The target hypothesis you are targeting to generate {{ targets }} for.
    2. The hypothesis generated in the previous steps and their corresponding feedbacks.
    3. Former proposed {{ targets }} on similar hypothesis.
    4. Some additional information to help you generate new {{ targets }}.
    Please generate the output following the format below:
    {{ experiment_output_format }}
    
  user_prompt: |-
    The user has made several hypothesis on this scenario and did several evaluation on them.
    The target hypothesis you are targeting to generate {{ targets }} for is as follows:
    {{ target_hypothesis }}
    {% if hypothesis_and_feedback %}
    The former hypothesis and the corresponding feedbacks are as follows:
    {{ hypothesis_and_feedback }}
    {% endif %}
    {% if last_hypothesis_and_feedback %}
    The latest hypothesis and the corresponding feedback are as follows:
    {{ last_hypothesis_and_feedback }}
    {% endif %}
    {% if sota_hypothesis_and_feedback %}
    The SOTA hypothesis and the corresponding feedback are as follows:
    {{ sota_hypothesis_and_feedback }}
    {% endif %}

    Please generate the new {{ targets }} based on the information above.
