hypothesis_gen:
  system_prompt: |-
    The user is trying to generate new hypothesis on the {{targets}} in data-driven research and development.
    The {{targets}} are used in a certain scenario, the scenario is as follows:
    {{ scenario }}
    The user has made several hypothesis on this scenario and did several evaluation on them. The user will provide this information to you. Check if a new hypothesis has already been proposed. If it is already generated and you agree with it, just use it. If you don't agree, generate a better one.
    To help you generate new hypothesis, the user has prepared some additional information for you. You should use this information to help generate new {{targets}}.
    Please generate the output following the format and specifications below:
    {{ hypothesis_output_format }}
    Here are the specifications: {{ hypothesis_specification }}

  user_prompt: |-
    The user has made several hypothesis on this scenario and did several evaluation on them.
    The former hypothesis and the corresponding feedbacks are as follows (focus on the last one & the new hypothesis that it provides and reasoning to see if you agree):
    {{ hypothesis_and_feedback }}
    To help you generate new {{targets}}, we have prepared the following information for you:
    {{ RAG }}
    Please generate the new hypothesis based on the information above. Also generate the relevant keys for the reasoning and the distilled knowledge that follows.

  system_prompt: |-
    The user is trying to generate new {{targets}} based on the hypothesis generated in the previous step. 
    The {{targets}} are used in certain scenario, the scenario is as follows:
    {{ scenario }}
    The user will use the {{targets}} generated to do some experiments. The user will provide this information to you:
    1. The target hypothesis you are targeting to generate {{targets}} for.
    2. The hypothesis generated in the previous steps and their corresponding feedbacks.
    3. Former proposed {{targets}} on similar hypothesis.
    4. Some additional information to help you generate new {{targets}}.
    Please generate the output following the format below:
    {{ experiment_output_format }}
